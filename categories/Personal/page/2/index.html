But when you’re out there partying, horsing around, someone out there at the same time is working hard. Someone is getting smarter and someone is winning.

</blockquote>
<p>Unfortunately, when you <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=13735610" target="_blank" rel="external">ask a question like that on the Internet</a>, you will get more bad responses than good. Who <em>really</em> wants to read comments, anyway? Startup idea.</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Identify what you actually want in life.</strong><br>If you don’t even know what you want or what goals you have, there is no way you can be motivated to reach it.<blockquote>
<p>“If you really, really want or need something then there’s usually also enough motivation to work towards it.” - rsp1984</p>
</blockquote>
</li>
<li><strong>Make your own startup.</strong><br>If you aren’t afraid of failing, that is. If you really believe in bluetooth tentacle robots, go out there and blow everyone out of the water.</li>
<li><strong>Calm yourself down when stimulation is not appropriate.</strong><br>Learn to switch yourself off every day. This can come in the form of yoga, meditation, or offline reading. Allow yourself to wake up to another day refreshed and ready for anything.</li>
<li><strong>Get a non-tech hobby.</strong><br>Helps you switch off.<blockquote>
<p>“Drawing, painting, knitting, dancing, a sport, volunteering at an animal shelter, gourmet cooking, write a novel, learn a new language.”” - webmaven</p>
</blockquote>
</li>
<li><strong>Keep challenging yourself out of your comfort zone.</strong><br>Once you get used to something, you’ll be good at it, and once you’re good at it, for some reason, you’ll start liking it. Example: self-automation, PHP.</li>
<li><strong>Go on a trip.</strong><br>Trips help you find yourself. Maybe you want to be a scuba diving instructor, not a programmer. Maybe you want to sell designer handbags for a living. Or do social work. Or design fireworks. Or become a priest. Talk to these people, and see what their lives are like.</li>
<li><strong>Take some vitamins.</strong><br>A lack of energy can occasionally be explained by a lack of vitamin D.</li>
<li><strong>Find new work.</strong><br>Maybe your work hours are too long. Or maybe the people you work with are bringing you down. Example: that loser Brian from work who always picks on your use of punctuation.</li>

    	<p>I believe everyone should learn something every day. Here is what I learned every so often.</p>
<h1 id="Working-with-yourself"><a href="#Working-with-yourself" class="headerlink" title="Working with yourself"></a>Working with yourself</h1><h2 id="Keep-a-journal"><a href="#Keep-a-journal" class="headerlink" title="Keep a journal"></a>Keep a journal</h2><p>Chances are, you won’t remember everything.<br>Keep a journal. For work. For home. For your personal life (sometimes known as a diary).<br>Write down what you did that day, and what you learned that day.<br>Not only does that help you remember everything, it helps you hold yourself accountable, too.</p>
<h2 id="Remember-what-people-said"><a href="#Remember-what-people-said" class="headerlink" title="Remember what people said"></a>Remember what people said</h2><p>People tell you things all the time. Then they expect you to remember everything.<br>Chances are, you won’t remember everything.<br>What down what people say. Later, you can find out why something was done this way or not this way, and hold them accountable, too.</p>
<h2 id="Know-what-people-do-in-the-company"><a href="#Know-what-people-do-in-the-company" class="headerlink" title="Know what people do in the company"></a>Know what people do in the company</h2><p>It will eventually come to you that not everyone in your company is a developer, and they all do different things. They all <em>want</em> different things out of their jobs, and they have different objectives to what they do.<br>You should observe what they do, know the things they pay close attention to, and learn from them.</p>
<h2 id="Memorise-the-org-chart"><a href="#Memorise-the-org-chart" class="headerlink" title="Memorise the org chart"></a>Memorise the org chart</h2><p>It is rarely wise to let others tell you what to do, when they aren’t in your department.<br>This is less important in a startup, of course, but remember, no one budgeted your sprint time for other departments’ activities.<br>Likewise (37), if someone higher up messages you directly, there is no hard requirement for you to respond directly, either (though you should).</p>
<h2 id="There’s-no-point-if-you-aren’t-the-best"><a href="#There’s-no-point-if-you-aren’t-the-best" class="headerlink" title="There’s no point if you aren’t the best"></a>There’s no point if you aren’t the best</h2><p>No one hired you to be mediocre. Therefore, only only must you be the best, you must be <em>your</em> best.</p>
<h2 id="Log-your-sick-and-vacation-days"><a href="#Log-your-sick-and-vacation-days" class="headerlink" title="Log your sick (and vacation) days"></a>Log your sick (and vacation) days</h2><p>Everyone should be keeping track of themselves.<br>Eliminate the means of your company screwing you over on paid days off.</p>
<h2 id="Make-friends"><a href="#Make-friends" class="headerlink" title="Make friends"></a>Make friends</h2><p>On a personal level, you will want to build relationships with the people who work with you.<br>A happy colleague is a happy you.</p>
<h2 id="If-it-isn’t-difficult-it-isn’t-worth-doing"><a href="#If-it-isn’t-difficult-it-isn’t-worth-doing" class="headerlink" title="If it isn’t difficult, it isn’t worth doing"></a>If it isn’t difficult, it isn’t worth doing</h2><p>You learn only by challenging yourselves. Being an accountant for a decade doesn’t make you better at making spreadsheets than one who’s fresh out of college.<br>Use your time wisely. When it comes to problem selection, choose the hard ones.</p>
<h2 id="Leave-your-comfort-zone"><a href="#Leave-your-comfort-zone" class="headerlink" title="Leave your comfort zone"></a>Leave your comfort zone</h2><p>Work on other projects. <a href="/2016/How-to-learn-how-to-learn/">Start small. The most important thing is to start, and don’t give up until you finish.</a></p>
<h2 id="Help-out"><a href="#Help-out" class="headerlink" title="Help out"></a>Help out</h2><p>When people need help, that means the problem is either hard (in which you can learn), or easy (for which you earn respect.) It’s a win-win.<br>(Or they’re trying to waste your time with mundane things. Need to watch out for that.)</p>
<h2 id="Expand-your-horizons"><a href="#Expand-your-horizons" class="headerlink" title="Expand your horizons"></a>Expand your horizons</h2><p>The world doesn’t just do what you do; go out there and learn some stuff. If you know C++, learn Java.</p>
<h2 id="Excel-in-your-territory"><a href="#Excel-in-your-territory" class="headerlink" title="Excel in your territory"></a>Excel in your territory</h2><p>“Be good at what you do” should be your baseline.<br>“Be the best at what you do” should be your benchmark.<br>“Be the best at what everyone else does” should be your life goal.</p>
<h2 id="If-you-don’t-know-something-ask"><a href="#If-you-don’t-know-something-ask" class="headerlink" title="If you don’t know something, ask"></a>If you don’t know something, ask</h2><p>Asking questions almost always means you get a better idea at something, especially outside your area of expertise.<br>Also, asking questions, much like a favour, makes people like you. This is a form of social engineering.</p>
<h2 id="Don’t-wait-until-something-becomes-a-problem"><a href="#Don’t-wait-until-something-becomes-a-problem" class="headerlink" title="Don’t wait until something becomes a problem"></a>Don’t wait until something becomes a problem</h2><p>Whatever you built inevitably has bugs (unless you did write 10000 tests for every line of code, which is not unheard of.) Some bugs are merged with the expectation that they are never considered a use case for the feature.<br>If you have time, close those holes. You don’t want someone to hack you one day.</p>
<h2 id="Don’t-let-production-users-find-your-bugs-15"><a href="#Don’t-let-production-users-find-your-bugs-15" class="headerlink" title="Don’t let production users find your bugs (15)"></a>Don’t let production users find your bugs (15)</h2><p>Knowingly pushing buggy code, knowing there is a deadline, should not be part of your work culture.<br>Once you show your users buggy code, there is no way to undo that mistake.</p>
<p><strong>Counter argument</strong>: “If a flag can get it done let’s get it done. Launching is the best way to find problems to fix” (29)</p>
<h2 id="Be-ready-to-fix-things-on-production-42"><a href="#Be-ready-to-fix-things-on-production-42" class="headerlink" title="Be ready to fix things on production (42)"></a>Be ready to fix things on production (42)</h2><p>Production services should never have errors. One advantage of being in an error-free state is the error emails that you (must set up, and) receive will be actual errors that you must fix, so you don’t simply filter them away.</p>
<h2 id="Implement-to-the-spec-17"><a href="#Implement-to-the-spec-17" class="headerlink" title="Implement to the spec (17)"></a>Implement to the spec (17)</h2><p>Once a spec is done, whatever is within the spec, you do exactly what the spec says. <em>The only parts within your control is that which is not written down.</em></p>
<h2 id="“If-you-are-given-your-own-job-would-you-take-it-”"><a href="#“If-you-are-given-your-own-job-would-you-take-it-”" class="headerlink" title="“If you are given your own job, would you take it?”"></a>“If you are given your own job, would you take it?”</h2><p>To do a good job, you must like what you do. If you are offered your own job right now, and you don’t want to take it, then you are probably both in a bad job, and doing a bad job.</p>
<h1 id="Working-with-code"><a href="#Working-with-code" class="headerlink" title="Working with code"></a>Working with code</h1><h2 id="Write-tests"><a href="#Write-tests" class="headerlink" title="Write tests"></a>Write tests</h2><p>Tests can sometimes save you back more time than the time you spend writing them.<br>Well, depends on how the code was written, anyway. More about testable code later.</p>
<h2 id="Make-small-tasks-for-yourself-2"><a href="#Make-small-tasks-for-yourself-2" class="headerlink" title="Make small tasks for yourself (2)"></a>Make small tasks for yourself (2)</h2><p>Break your tasks into smaller, understandable pieces.</p>
<p>Someone might come to you and say, “build me this.”<br>When “this” is a huge endeavour, you will be overwhelmed by the requirements and deadline planning. You don’t actually know what “this” entails.</p>
<h2 id="Make-a-feature-branch-if-the-task-is-big-47"><a href="#Make-a-feature-branch-if-the-task-is-big-47" class="headerlink" title="Make a feature branch if the task is big (47)"></a>Make a feature branch if the task is big (47)</h2><p>A task can be so large that requires collaboration among developers in near real time.<br>In that case, it is probably better to work on a branch, pushing directly to it, and submit the final product for review, rather than submitting each individual change, which the QA must test one by one.</p>
<h2 id="Tests-will-fail"><a href="#Tests-will-fail" class="headerlink" title="Tests will fail"></a>Tests will fail</h2><p>And not only will they fail, they will be hard to fix. The 1/100/10000 rule states that for every second of code you write, you will spend 100 seconds writing tests, and 10000 more wondering why they don’t all pass. </p>
<h2 id="Make-small-changes"><a href="#Make-small-changes" class="headerlink" title="Make small changes"></a>Make small changes</h2><p>No one wants to read big changes. No one wants to test big changes.<br>When you make a big change, QA will ignore you until all other changes are merged.<br>So then you’ll have to rebase.<br>And get code reviews done, all over again.<br>Make small changes.</p>
<h2 id="Other-people’s-tech-debt-are-yours…"><a href="#Other-people’s-tech-debt-are-yours…" class="headerlink" title="Other people’s tech debt are yours…"></a>Other people’s tech debt are yours…</h2><p>If my experience is anything to go by, then I can say for certain that only you will care about technical debt.<br>Overestimate your stories so you get time to recover from the chronic debt.</p>
<p>If you happen to be a project lead, the tech debt you <em>allow</em> into your code base become yours, too. Make careful decisions before you approve or disapprove a change (45).</p>
<h2 id="…And-tech-debt-can-kill-you"><a href="#…And-tech-debt-can-kill-you" class="headerlink" title="…And tech debt can kill you"></a>…And tech debt can kill you</h2><p>After a lot of technical debt, you will start to develop mental issues. You will burn out and require actual medical care.<br>Do not ignore burnout! Take care of yourself first. Work isn’t everything.</p>
<h2 id="Users-are-stupid"><a href="#Users-are-stupid" class="headerlink" title="Users are stupid"></a>Users are stupid</h2><p>And they always, always overestimate their intelligence. There is an art to implementing unassuming UX, and you have not mastered it yet.</p>
<h2 id="Write-your-own-integration-tests"><a href="#Write-your-own-integration-tests" class="headerlink" title="Write your own integration tests"></a>Write your own integration tests</h2><p>If something breaks across components, the blame will simply be placed on you. To avoid things like that, cover yourself with some more tests.<br>No one (here) has ever said no to more tests.</p>
<h2 id="Your-code-represents-you"><a href="#Your-code-represents-you" class="headerlink" title="Your code represents you"></a>Your code represents you</h2><p>Make sure you like the looks of something before you push it out to the world. If you do a crappy job of designing an interface, your users will think</p>
<p>1) your product is a joke,<br>1) your company is a joke, and<br>1) you are a joke.</p>
<p>One or more of these may concern you. “Don’t feel pressured to push something you’re not happy with.” (30)</p>
<h2 id="Every-feature-must-have-an-on-off-switch-28"><a href="#Every-feature-must-have-an-on-off-switch-28" class="headerlink" title="Every feature must have an on/off switch (28)"></a>Every feature must have an on/off switch (28)</h2><blockquote>
<p>At least don’t make things worse than they are now [on production]. - The wise man</p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="Don’t-start-a-task-until-you-know-what-you-should-be-doing-28-42"><a href="#Don’t-start-a-task-until-you-know-what-you-should-be-doing-28-42" class="headerlink" title="Don’t start [a task] until you know what you should be doing (28, 42)"></a>Don’t start [a task] until you know what you should be doing (28, 42)</h2><p>Spearheading a task, without knowing its intended function and/or outcome, will simply waste your time if you get it wrong.<br>In the face of ambiguity, refuse the temptation to guess.</p>
<h2 id="Don’t-keep-builds-broken"><a href="#Don’t-keep-builds-broken" class="headerlink" title="Don’t keep builds broken"></a>Don’t keep builds broken</h2><p>If you keep (Jenkins) builds broken, how would you know when they find new bugs?<br>Failing builds should be dealt with swiftly.</p>
<h2 id="Document-your-changes-51"><a href="#Document-your-changes-51" class="headerlink" title="Document your changes (51)"></a>Document your changes (51)</h2><p>After a week or two, people will start to forget what does what, or what changed so it no longer does what.<br>It is probably for the best to dedicate some time to document the most updated state of any system, so you won’t need to read through all the code to find out how something works.</p>
<h1 id="Working-with-teams"><a href="#Working-with-teams" class="headerlink" title="Working with teams"></a>Working with teams</h1><h2 id="Demos-are-done-to-impress-3-38"><a href="#Demos-are-done-to-impress-3-38" class="headerlink" title="Demos are done to impress (~3, 38)"></a>Demos are done to impress (~3, 38)</h2><blockquote>
<p>“Only demo that which ought to impress”.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Don’t demo useless things.<br>The whole point of the demo is to show [people] what you’ve done (…), not to see what other people have done. Demos are a proof of work or proof of progress, something you should be proud of showing at the end of a development period.</p>
<h2 id="Business-deadlines-are-your-deadlines"><a href="#Business-deadlines-are-your-deadlines" class="headerlink" title="Business deadlines are your deadlines"></a>Business deadlines are your deadlines</h2><p>Usually, you aren’t hired to “work on a project”; you are hired to provide business value. And deadlines indirectly come from the business people who need your project done, so they can <em>actually</em> provide business value.</p>
<h2 id="As-a-team-no-one-knows-what-they’re-doing-4"><a href="#As-a-team-no-one-knows-what-they’re-doing-4" class="headerlink" title="As a team, no one knows what they’re doing (~4)"></a>As a team, no one knows what they’re doing (~4)</h2><p>One day someone might say, “developers should specify acceptance criteria.”<br>Then, in a month or two, the same person can come and say “the stakeholder (read: business) should provide a definition of done.”<br>No one knows what they’re doing.</p>
<h2 id="Pipelines-are-meant-to-be-balanced"><a href="#Pipelines-are-meant-to-be-balanced" class="headerlink" title="Pipelines are meant to be balanced"></a>Pipelines are meant to be balanced</h2><p>Too many code reviews at the same time and it burdens developers.<br>Too many things in test at the same time and it burdens QA.<br>Ideally, when a swim lane reaches a threshold, members should join code review and/or testing, so the overall velocity remains high.</p>
<p>Anyone can be QA. (Even if you suck at it, you can improve, right?)</p>
<h2 id="Don’t-let-QA-find-your-problems"><a href="#Don’t-let-QA-find-your-problems" class="headerlink" title="Don’t let QA find your problems"></a>Don’t let QA find your problems</h2><p>Your code is supposed to be free of bugs the moment it is submitted for review, so that when it passes code reviews, testing will find absolutely nothing.<br>Test your own code like it belongs to your arch enemy.</p>
<h2 id="Be-ready-to-replace-your-seniors"><a href="#Be-ready-to-replace-your-seniors" class="headerlink" title="Be ready to replace your seniors"></a>Be ready to replace your seniors</h2><p>Seniors, and even bosses come and go, and you should be the one ready to fill in their shoes. This gives you, supposedly, an advantage when it comes to readiness.</p>
<h2 id="Release-regularly-36"><a href="#Release-regularly-36" class="headerlink" title="Release regularly (36)"></a>Release regularly (36)</h2><p>The more regular releases are, the more likely bugs are to be found early.<br>Continuous deployment is its own beast so we will look into that on its own.</p>
<p>If you lead a project, you must (at least tell yourself that) release your project at the end of every development period.</p>
<h2 id="Success-metrics-should-be-independent-from-each-other"><a href="#Success-metrics-should-be-independent-from-each-other" class="headerlink" title="Success metrics should be independent from each other"></a>Success metrics should be independent from each other</h2><p>If you set your own goals, make sure they don’t depend on each other. This allows you to meet these goals one by one, and ensure you actually made (e.g. 3) goals, rather than just (e.g. 1).</p>
<h2 id="Plan-the-backlog-not-the-sprint-27"><a href="#Plan-the-backlog-not-the-sprint-27" class="headerlink" title="Plan the backlog, not the sprint (27)"></a>Plan the backlog, not the sprint (27)</h2><p>Developers should be taking the first task at the top of the backlog for more work.<br>Unordered backlogs mean unhappy developers (because unhappy businessmen don’t get the right features done). (34)</p>
<blockquote>
<p>If you don’t plan the sprints, when will they stop failing? - The wise man</p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="Don’t-do-multiple-tasks-at-the-same-time-50"><a href="#Don’t-do-multiple-tasks-at-the-same-time-50" class="headerlink" title="Don’t do multiple tasks at the same time (50)"></a>Don’t do multiple tasks at the same time (50)</h2><p>Chances are that you will end up running out of time, failing to merge all of them. Work on one thing, finish it, then work on another.</p>
<h2 id="Make-suggestions-not-criticisms-29"><a href="#Make-suggestions-not-criticisms-29" class="headerlink" title="Make suggestions, not criticisms (29)"></a>Make suggestions, not criticisms (29)</h2><p>Doing code reviews can be fun, especially when you bash someone else’s head in for writing atrocious code.<br>But resist that sadistic temptation. Help the other person grow by making suggestions. Forcing yourself to architectural questions also helps with your critical thinking.</p>
<h2 id="Keep-confidential-information-confidential-35"><a href="#Keep-confidential-information-confidential-35" class="headerlink" title="Keep confidential information confidential (35)"></a>Keep confidential information confidential (35)</h2><p>Put your company in a good light. Don’t write stupid blog posts that expose confidential trade secrets.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Let’s conduce ourselves as professionally as we can.<br>Don’t feel obligated to tell your users how things work (37).</p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="Gauge-your-sprint-velocities-39"><a href="#Gauge-your-sprint-velocities-39" class="headerlink" title="Gauge your sprint velocities (39)"></a>Gauge your sprint velocities (39)</h2><p>Put too little into one sprint, and you, as a business, will fail.<br>Try to put too much into one sprint, and the sprint will certainly fail.</p>

    	<p>My landlord is letting his place go on sale. This also means my eviction is in order (and, given the reason, has a very generous notice required by law). It is time to revisit what it was like to live alone, and what people with similar experiences gained/missed.</p>
<h1 id="Pros"><a href="#Pros" class="headerlink" title="Pros"></a>Pros</h1><ol>
<li>No one will ever touch your food.</li>
<li>The whole fridge is yours.</li>
<li>You can talk to yourself without anyone else thinking you are crazy.</li>
<li>Cleaning schedule is “whenever”.</li>
<li>No quiet hours (except otherwise specified by building).</li>
<li>No one touches your electrical appliances (if any), and they are always available to use. Wash your clothes at 3am if you want.</li>
<li>You can sing in the shower as poorly as your heart desires.</li>
<li>You are almost guaranteed more space per capita.</li>
<li>The door is where you put <em>your</em> shoes.</li>
<li>Thermostat is set by you. Air conditioning is set by you.</li>
<li>Your place may be eligible for 100% of the parking spots (which is usually one).</li>
<li>Can poop with door open. The stench is always your very own.</li>
<li>The bathroom is always free. Toilet paper lasts forever.</li>
<li><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/1z996r/what_are_some_of_the_perks_when_living_by_yourself/" target="_blank" rel="external">Everything is always where you left it.</a></li>
<li>You can have friends over any time.</li>
<li>You can be completely naked, anywhere, anytime. You can also <em>do</em> anything while naked, anywhere, anytime.</li>
<li>No one uses your soap. You can be sure your razor has not touched the testes of any man (or any other man).</li>
<li>All the Internet bandwidth belongs to you. Also, no one will hack you from the inside.</li>
<li>The sink can be used, perpetually, for soaking dishes that really needed soaking, rather than being called a lazy bastard every other hour.</li>
<li>You can keep various pets and plants with only your rental agreement and/or the law to worry about (where applicable).</li>
<li>You can choose <em>where</em> to sleep. You can sleep on the couch, the laundry room, or above the toilet bowl for all we care.</li>
<li>You can fill the entire house/apartment with cooking smoke and only you will be shamed of what you did.</li>
</ol>
<h1 id="Cons"><a href="#Cons" class="headerlink" title="Cons"></a>Cons</h1><ol>
<li>Appliances might not come as standard. May need to do your laundry elsewhere.</li>
<li>No noise made by other humans. Can be lonely.</li>
<li>You pay all bills not covered by the lease. This is less likely when living with others.</li>
<li>More expensive rent per capita. Sometimes also higher per unit area.</li>
<li>If anything squeaks and leaks or falls apart, you know you are the only person who could have broken it.</li>
<li>You are almost certainly guaranteed not to have a dishwasher. You might not even have a proper stove.</li>
<li>If anything is dirty, you are cleaning it. Though, you know you were the one dirtying it in the first place.</li>
<li>With no one to gauge your QOL, it is completely possible that you will become a social degenerate.</li>
<li>Inability to share 4L bags of milk.</li>
<li>You never carpool (except if you drive for Uber, maybe).</li>
<li>You never share the cost of your car.</li>
<li>No one will share their Netflix account with you.</li>
<li>If you have a pet, you and you alone must walk it.</li>
<li>You alone will defend the home intruder.</li>
<li>You can invite friends over only if you have the space. You might not have the space.</li>
<li>Losing keys can be a very costly ordeal.</li>
<li>No one to practice interviews with. Or talk to, on a daily basis.</li>
<li>If you torrent anything, they will know it is you.</li>
<li>Too much free space might pressure you to get all sorts of furniture you never needed.</li>
<li>You pay your own home insurance.</li>
<li>Snow? You are shovelling (where applicable). Grass? You might get away with paying a boy to cut it for you, but that also costs money.</li>
<li>It is less likely that you will find someone willing to help you move.</li>
<li>If you are a stroke or heart attack, you die.</li>

    	<p>The community list of red flags when assessing a roommate/potential roommate is as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>Insists on putting their name on their own food in the fridge, while eating all unlabelled food when no one else is doing it.</li>
<li>Has a mother move in for them. Chances are, this roommate will not be doing their own chores.</li>
<li>Expects the place to be clean, yet, does not clean anything.</li>
<li>Has a smell that lingers wherever they go.</li>
<li>Was forced to move out by their former roommates.</li>
<li>Is close to you. Once they move in, their flaws magnify. The closer you were, the more flaws you’ll find. Not a bad thing if they are nice though, since that magnifies positively as well.</li>
<li>Mentions how clean the place is before/upon move-in. Indicates different living/cleanliness standards.</li>
<li>Is a problem drunk. Sleep drunk is their own business.</li>
<li>Posts post-it notes in the house. Evidence of passive-aggression.</li>
<li>Always keeps the door open (sociopath), or always keeps the door closed (anti-social).</li>
<li>Leave dishes lying around.</li>
<li>For some reason, showers or poops with the door open, or showers and poops at the same time.</li>
<li>Uses metal utensils on non-stick pans (only madmen do this).</li>
<li>Has incredibly loud sex, but does not have the courtesy to invite you.</li>
<li>Drops weights on hardwood flooring.</li>
<li>Is alcoholic, and expects roommates carry them home.</li>
<li>Doesn’t have a job, and is not looking for one.</li>
<li>Has no sense of humour.</li>
<li>Distributes drugs outdoors as an occupation.</li>
<li>Has a Tumblr account.</li>
<li>Says, “I like to party occasionally.” If they have to say it, they know very well what occasionally means.</li>
<li>Is in debt.</li>
<li>Is a Republican. Even if your country of residence does not have a Republican party, this still applies.</li>
<li>Mentions to you, and makes sure everyone knows, that someone has a restraining order against them.</li>
<li>Has a degree in chemistry, and asks if anyone else is using the shed.</li>
<li>Smokes, or if you find any indoor ashtrays.</li>
<li>Mentions “I cook bad food”. That just means “I burn the stove a lot”.</li>
<li>Is the bad kind of racist. “Bad” is the difference between “haha Germans can’t make jokes” and “haha Germans should kill themselves”.</li>
