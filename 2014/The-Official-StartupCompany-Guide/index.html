    	<p>Welcome to StartupCompany. In this guide, you will learn what is necessary to work with StartupCompany as a developer.</p>
<ol>
<li>You will be assigned tasks to work on. As our development is results-driven, you will not be given deadlines until the due date.</li>
<li>The business team makes decisions based on the team’s intuition. You will be notified of their intuition when the client demands something.</li>
<li>Often, deadlines may be from an earlier point in time.</li>
<li>We run our in-house Test-Driven Development (TDD). All our tests are currently passing – new team members are expected to write zero tests.</li>
<li>StartupCompany. frequently gives away free trials to customers. The conversion rate of these trials has so far been 0%. Your responsibility is to make these free trials a reality. </li>
<li>As a form of money management, the CEO will pay you with money that will eventually exist in six-month’s time. If there is no money in the bank before the sixth month, you will not be paid.</li>
<li>As an expert in the field, you will be expected to write code that works from IE7 to IE12, including development and debug builds of desktop and mobile browsers. </li>
<li>Every developer is encouraged to document their code and processes. You can find our large repository of outdated docs in our FreeProduct repository. </li>
<li>Here at StartupCompany, we strive for results. Using the Thick Loaves(TM) philosophy, you are encouraged to push code to production every 5 minutes, however stable it is, as long as it is stable. (see point 7)  </li>
<li>Employees are expected to complete tasks in under 50% of the allocated time. </li>
<li>We have many clients, and, as such, have to fulfill requirements from each client. You will be creating marvelous work of art that does all that with just one code base. </li>
<li>You, as a new member at StartupCompany, are very special. We treat you like a team. The whole team.</li>
<li>We use Dipchat as our company issue tracker. If you find a bug, please file it inside the room named ‘Developers’. The bugs that you file will not be resolved; the bugs that you address will not be acknowledged.</li>
<li>The Business team has no technical knowledge related to building and designing a product. As such, if they ask you how long something would take to implement, please work with them and reply with ‘a very short time.’</li>
<li>We are a six year-old company, and we have made a lot of great products in the past. You will be working on a relatively new project that needs to have features from all previous iterations.</li>
<li>After reading about Exception-driven development (EDD) on Hacker News, we have adopted it as a practice. The moral of the story here is that if we monitor our systems, then they will not fail.</li>
