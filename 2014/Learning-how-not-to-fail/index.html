    	<p>Startups (start-ups) are hard.</p>
<p>You are the CEO of <em>QuickHolland</em>, a company that sells instant hollandaise sauce (currently in R&amp;D) in revolutionary, squeeze-bottle form factor.</p>
<p>As a founder in a startup, you likely have several priorities to juggle:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Maintaining your vision</strong>, because it is <em>your</em> company</li>
<li><strong>Maintaining investor relations</strong>, to get advice from them (if they are on the board) or to have a constant source of funding</li>
<li><strong>Managing your day-to-day business</strong>, because, again, this company is yours to run.</li>
</ol>
<p>This post explains why it is often difficult to do all of these things.</p>
<h2 id="1-Maintaining-your-vision"><a href="#1-Maintaining-your-vision" class="headerlink" title="1. Maintaining your vision"></a>1. Maintaining your vision</h2><p>Your mother just spent an hour <a href="http://ciaoegrazie.wordpress.com/tag/gordon-ramsays-hollandaise-sauce/" target="_blank" rel="external">making hollandaise sauce from scratch</a>, and she complains to you that it was too time-consuming a thing to do in the morning–when people need to get to work on time.</p>
<p>You have an idea; a lightbulb glowed atop your head. Instant hollandaise sauce. You narrow your vision. You set your goal. You incorporate your company. And you hire on the best people you know.</p>
<p>Now what?</p>
<p><strong>Is it your job to stick to the vision, or is it sometimes appropriate to modify the company’s vision?</strong></p>
<p>One year into your saucy enterprise, you find yourself in a sticky situation, where your food scientists come up with something in a squeeze bottle, but no one is buying it. “But build it and they will come,” you think to yourself, “maybe I am not reaching the correct market.”</p>
<p>You pitch your idea to your investors and they say that your idea reeks of unoriginality. They say that it has been done before. “Is this like other hollandaise sauces out there, except <del>on social networks</del>in a squeeze bottle?” You tell them yes, but, see, the squeeze bottle is what we’re <em>really</em> selling. Your investors, agreeing with your explanation, throw money at you for another year of runway.</p>
<p><strong>Are you now selling hollandaise sauce, or are you now selling squeeze bottles?</strong></p>
<p>You go back to your team of scientists and tell them you have decided to <em>pivot</em>. To pivot is to change the direction of the company–your corporate vision has now changed. Half of your team leaves your company because they are food scientists, not petroleum engineers (who would be the people who commonly make squeeze bottles). “No matter,” you think to yourself, “I have <em>leads</em>.”</p>
<h2 id="2-Maintaining-investor-relations"><a href="#2-Maintaining-investor-relations" class="headerlink" title="2. Maintaining investor relations"></a>2. Maintaining investor relations</h2><p>You own 100% of the company, but you need some initial funding, so the first course of action, of course, is to ask family and friends for your “bootstrap” money. That money buys you time, the ability to pay lawyers and governments for business-related fees, and money to hire your first employee.</p>
<p>Of course, you will almost certainly want to hire more than one employee, so you sell your company’s <em>shares</em>, to your investors (wherever you got hold of them to begin with), for instant funding, paid back by them as <em>convertible notes</em>. With that capital, you hire your second, third, fourth employees, and so on. You know how long your <em>runway</em> is (how much money you have {div} how much money you spend per month), and so do your investors, because they request that kind of information. They give you funding because they know you have a team who can execute your idea. They give you funding because you seem like a competent leader. They give you funding because, ultimately, your company might succeed, which means more money for them.</p>
<p><strong>What if you don’t succeed?</strong></p>
<h2 id="3-Managing-your-day-to-day-business"><a href="#3-Managing-your-day-to-day-business" class="headerlink" title="3. Managing your day-to-day business"></a>3. Managing your day-to-day business</h2><p><em>QuickHolland</em> is your first business, and it is your baby. By now, you have been working on it for three years, and you have pivoted three times so far; your company now prints posters for supermarkets that sell your brilliant squeeze bottles, turning your company into an advertising agency. You still have your brilliant team of people, but only one food scientist is left at this point, because the company isn’t really making food anymore.</p>
<p>On your fourth year, you run out of funding (which is a surprising amount of time, because investors gave you only one year’s worth of money.) You cannot pay your employees for the time being, but, no matter, this too shall pass. You try very hard to look for new investors. You get about half a year worth of runway, yet again, saving the company once more.</p>
<p><strong>Are you going to pay your employees their unsettled wages? If so, how?</strong></p>
<p>Once, while swimming in Salt Lake, you encounter a young, attractive woman, who happens to be interested in you. You two share the same interests, same backgrounds, and quickly fall in love. Once she moves in, You quickly realise that you no longer have the time and patience to run and maintain the company that was once your baby and vision. Hell, it isn’t even what your mother asked for anymore.</p>
<p><strong>What comes first? Your life, or your company?</strong></p>
