    	<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrYx7HaUlMY" target="_blank" rel="external">Paula Stone Williams</a> was a man and now a transgender woman. By living life on both sides, she gets to see the world… at least from more perspectives than most of us. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gas-kL_AjSQ" target="_blank" rel="external">Other trans people speak out</a>, too. Let’s see what they have to say, before and after changing gender.</p>
<h1 id="Life-as-a-man-pros"><a href="#Life-as-a-man-pros" class="headerlink" title="Life as a man, pros"></a>Life as a man, pros</h1><ul>
<li>People respect you.</li>
<li>People take (you, and what you talk about) seriously. This eliminates a man’s need to doubt himself.</li>
<li>People don’t assume you are stupid.</li>
<li>Men typically aren’t mean to other men.</li>
<li>Men don’t need to apologise for being right.</li>
<li>Men don’t have periods. They also never hurt due to pregnancy and childbirth.</li>
<li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g-92FZPNWNs" target="_blank" rel="external">People rarely spike your drinks</a>. Although male rape does exist, it is reported much less frequently.</li>
<li>Women don’t (sexually) harass you or, to a lesser extent, your appearance.</li>
<li>It is not scary to walk alone at night.</li>
<li>Typically, no makeup is required to appear normal.</li>
<li>A man’s <a href="https://www.quora.com/What-are-the-pros-and-cons-of-being-a-girl-vs-being-a-guy#" target="_blank" rel="external">attractiveness</a> does not drop off sharply at age 30.</li>
<li>It is much easier for you to pursue a leadership role if you are a man.</li>
<li>The vast majority of organised religions don’t oppress men.</li>
</ul>
<p>The little things:</p>
<ul>
<li>Jeans pockets can actually hold things.</li>
<li>Things never fall out of any pocket.</li>
<li>Male skin is thicker and more protective.</li>
<li>Clothing sizing numbers actually mean something.</li>
</ul>
<h1 id="Life-as-a-woman-pros"><a href="#Life-as-a-woman-pros" class="headerlink" title="Life as a woman, pros"></a>Life as a woman, pros</h1><ul>
<li>It is okay to be short (being fat is another thing, but at least you can control it).</li>
<li>Haircuts are required less often.</li>
<li>Women live longer.</li>
<li>Women can choose to be fabulous.</li>
<li>When it comes to dating, you get plenty of choices.</li>
<li>Women are far less lonely in this world, and share their feelings and affection.</li>
<li>A woman’s value is not derived from her ability to provide.</li>
<li>A woman’s occupation is cleaner on average, mainly skewed by some men working sewage, mining, construction, and other forms of hard labour.</li>
<li><a href="https://www.quora.com/What-are-the-pros-and-cons-of-being-a-girl-vs-being-a-guy#" target="_blank" rel="external">Less is expected of women</a>: the world is not on their shoulders. Women do not <em>need</em> (at least seen by society) to do great things, and to achieve great heights in their careers.</li>
<li>It is socially acceptable to shop as much as you want and not care about your spending habits.</li>
<li>Women are free to be emotional—even weak—if so desired.</li>
<li>Women can have children, if that’s what you want.</li>
<li>Getting lighter sentences for crimes like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rape_by_gender#Rape_of_males_by_females" target="_blank" rel="external">rape</a> is among the social, political, and legal double standards that prefer women, such as custody.</li>
<li>In most countries, women are never conscripted for war.</li>
</ul>
<p><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/unpopularopinion/comments/hm1sce/as_a_woman_it_irritates_me_how_other_women_wont/fx2u417/" target="_blank" rel="external">/u/Zenla8282 put it nicely</a>: I think both men and women have it harder and easier in different ways, but usually when life gets tough, most of us don’t think “wow my life is so hard <em>because</em> I’m a woman/man”.</p>

    	<p>Derived from the eponymous TED talk, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c-4flnuxNV4" target="_blank" rel="external">“Why we make bad decisions” by Dan Gilbert</a>.</p>
<h1 id="Intuition-is-your-enemy"><a href="#Intuition-is-your-enemy" class="headerlink" title="Intuition is your enemy"></a>Intuition is your enemy</h1><p>The easier you recall something, the more “intuitive” it is. The more intuitive something seems, the more correct we think it is.</p>
<p>You recall reading the news. Explosions, plane crashes, roadside bombings. Therefore, surely they are more dangerous than drowning in swimming pools. (Statistically, they are not.)</p>
<p>You recall watching lottery winners win. You rarely see people <em>lose</em> the lottery. Therefore, <em>bummed by intuition, you massively overestimate the odds of you winning</em>.</p>
<p><strong>Overcoming intuition</strong>: think only in terms of expectation value (see below). If the expectation value is positive, it’s a good bet/deal no matter what it is.</p>
<h1 id="Comparison-is-your-enemy"><a href="#Comparison-is-your-enemy" class="headerlink" title="Comparison is your enemy"></a>Comparison is your enemy</h1><p>You go to a grocery store to buy the bottle of wine that is neither the cheapest nor the most expensive. You go to a stereo shop and buy the best-sounding speakers there. Once you make the purchase and take it come, these are comparisons you will never make again. <em>Comparison changes the value of things.</em></p>
<p><strong>To overcome</strong>: don’t compare with other items. It doesn’t matter how much things are that are next to it.</p>
<h1 id="The-past-is-your-enemy"><a href="#The-past-is-your-enemy" class="headerlink" title="The past is your enemy"></a>The past is your enemy</h1><p>You would gladly book a trip that goes from \$2000 to \$1600 (a deal), but not one that goes from \$2000, on sale for \$700 (a steal), but \$1500 by the time you could book (a better deal than $1600). Why? Because you anchor the trip’s value on its past (\$700).</p>
<p><strong>To overcome</strong>: don’t compare a value of something with its past. The past value doesn’t matter at all; its current and future values are the only things that matter.</p>
<h1 id="The-present-is-your-enemy"><a href="#The-present-is-your-enemy" class="headerlink" title="The present is your enemy"></a>The present is your enemy</h1><p>\$60 now is better than \$50 now. (“More is better”)</p>
<p>But \$50 now is better than \$60 in a month. (“Now is better”)</p>
<p><em>But</em> \$60 in 13 months is better than \$50 in 12 months, even though the amount of additional time you wait is the same as the second example.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Well, by and large people are enormously impatient. That is, they require interest rates in the hundred or thousands of percents in order to delay gratification and wait until next month for the extra 10 dollars.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><em>By comparing a potential future with the present, you underestimate the odds of your future pains, and overestimate the value of the present pleasures.</em> (Paraphrased from the TED talk)</p>
<p><strong>To overcome</strong>: your intuition is terrible. Do the maths, every time.</p>
<h1 id="The-golden-rule"><a href="#The-golden-rule" class="headerlink" title="The golden rule"></a>The golden rule</h1><p>$$<br>\operatorname{E}[X] =\sum_{i=1}^k x_i\,p_i=x_1p_1 + x_2p_2 + \cdots + x_kp_k.<br>$$</p>
<p>Expectation value = (odds of gain) * (value of gain).</p>

<p>The first thing these games do is set up a virtual currency so that it doesn’t feel like you’re spending real currency, even though you are.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Ask users to buy “coins” and “gold” with credit card, and never make the conversion rate easy, like 1 gold: 1 cent. Make it hard for the user to realise how much was actually spent.</p>
<h1 id="Don’t-make-users-feel-like-they-are-paying-with-real-money"><a href="#Don’t-make-users-feel-like-they-are-paying-with-real-money" class="headerlink" title="Don’t make users feel like they are paying with real money"></a>Don’t make users feel like they are paying with real money</h1><blockquote>
<p>People find it harder to spend money when they’re paying in cash than if they’re using a card.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Require users to pay with a credit card, and force the card to be saved. This makes the user easier to spend money for subsequent impulse buys.<br>Apparently, tourist attractions also do this, because they hold foreign currency with an unfamiliar value.</p>

<p>If incense costs 80 pokecoins and a batch of 550 pokecoins costs $4.99, how much real money does incense cost? Yeah i don’t know either.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It is hard to determine the amount of money spent <em>and</em> the amount of virtual currency being spent, making micropayments seem virtual to stupid users.<br>Paying with virtual currency also has the advantage of bypassing the credit card.</p>

<p>Some in-game items are purely gambling. Users will convince themselves than spending 880 Nexon cash (or whatever it’s called) is a good idea for buying a <a href="https://maplewiki.net/index.php?title=Gachapon" target="_blank" rel="external">“Gachapon”</a>, a lottery service that may or may not yield an in-game item more valuable than 880 currency units.</p>

Pay to lure more pokemon, pay to save progress at any time, pay to get a slightly better weapon. The game can still be played without payments, but it seems to users that they can simply pay to wipe the pain away.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>They have the incentives to insert pain points into the game.</p>

	<div class="entry-content">
		
    	<p>(This is a summary of <a href="https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/the-freedom-change/201502/the-keys-rewarding-relationships-secure-attachment" target="_blank" rel="external">an article of the same name</a>.)</p>
<p>People with a “secure attachment style” can handle strong emotions and not be hijacked by them. About 55% of people grew up with it.</p>
<p>When parents are consistently available, warm, and responsive, (when the children get scared or distressed) the children develop secure attachment styles.</p>
<p>Soothing a child when distressed is called “up-regulating” the child’s emotions. For example, if you have ever seen a toddler fall and bang his or her knee; the first thing the child will typically do before crying is look at her mother or father’s face for a non-verbal signal as to how serious the injury is. It is as if the child is asking “What am I feeling?”</p>
<p>Because the child learns that he/she can feel scared or distressed, and then get comfort and be helped to feel better, they learn that negative emotions can be tolerated and managed effectively.  By extension, once they grow into adulthood, they don’t worry too much about other people leaving them or about getting hurt in relationships.</p>
