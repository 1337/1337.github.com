    	<p>Summary of <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/5q69um/how_do_you_subtly_fuck_with_people/" target="_blank" rel="external">this post</a></p>
<ol>
<li>Add keywords like “underwear, car loan, suicide watch” in white font in your emails to get your recipients ad-targeted by them.</li>
<li>“Hey there’s something different about you today, I like it”</li>
<li>When making a multiple choice quiz, make all the correct answers the first one.</li>
<li>Introduce yourself with different names at a party/event.</li>
<li>Slightly rearrange things on someone’s desk.</li>
<li>When reserving a table, name yourself “par par” or “for for”, which forces the waiter/waitress to call out “par par party for two” or “for for for four”.</li>
<li>When answering the phone, answer with “Hi, can I speak to [caller] please”.</li>
<li>Always say “See you tomorrow”, whether or not it is actually going to happen.</li>
<li>End a call or drive-thru with “thanks I love you”.</li>
<li>Bring snacks into the office on April Fool’s day.</li>
<li>Change terms slightly. Game of the Thrones, SnapChap, Los Vegas.</li>
<li>Remember someone’s story, then later tell it back to them as if it happened to you.</li>
<li>Wear a shirt and tie for no reason to work every so often.</li>
<li>When someone asks you if you want something out of courtesy, catch them off guard by actually saying yes. Yes, you would like water.</li>
<li>Reference imaginary famous people in your conversation, and see if anyone notices you made them up.</li>
<li>When someone stops talking, look at them in the eyes until they start talking again.</li>
<li>When someone sneezes, say “thank you” instead of “bless you”. Also works: tell them to shut up, and they will say “thank you” back because they were expecting a “bless you”.</li>
<li>Make up skills for people you barely know. Did you know Maggie can fix watches?</li>
<li>When entering an elevator with people already inside, face them.</li>
<li>“Get them heavily involved in a good conversation, while standing, and just hand them something. Don’t look at it, keep the conversation going, keep eye contact, and hand them anything from a tennis ball to a rock you just picked up. Almost every time they’ll grab it without thinking. Works even better if talking and walking. See how much stuff they can hold.”</li>
<li>“Thanks, you too” to any service industry worker.</li>
<li>Say “to go” when ordering from the drive thru. If you want to make yourself look stupid, “for here” works too.</li>
<li>Claim that you have never heard of a well known country, like Spain.</li>
<li>When people give you a phone to take a group picture, turn around and take a selfie with them.</li>
</ol>

    	<p>Derived from a video by <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fKK9nVLvhGM" target="_blank" rel="external">Vox</a>, whose <a href="http://eventbeat.org/how-free-games-are-designed-to-make-money/" target="_blank" rel="external">transcript</a> was found elsewhere.</p>
<h1 id="Dissociate-payments-with-real-money"><a href="#Dissociate-payments-with-real-money" class="headerlink" title="Dissociate payments with real money"></a>Dissociate payments with real money</h1><blockquote>
<p>The first thing these games do is set up a virtual currency so that it doesn’t feel like you’re spending real currency, even though you are.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Ask users to buy “coins” and “gold” with credit card, and never make the conversion rate easy, like 1 gold: 1 cent. Make it hard for the user to realise how much was actually spent.</p>
<h1 id="Don’t-make-users-feel-like-they-are-paying-with-real-money"><a href="#Don’t-make-users-feel-like-they-are-paying-with-real-money" class="headerlink" title="Don’t make users feel like they are paying with real money"></a>Don’t make users feel like they are paying with real money</h1><blockquote>
<p>People find it harder to spend money when they’re paying in cash than if they’re using a card.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Require users to pay with a credit card, and force the card to be saved. This makes the user easier to spend money for subsequent impulse buys.<br>Apparently, tourist attractions also do this, because they hold foreign currency with an unfamiliar value.</p>
<h1 id="Make-users-pay-with-virtual-currency"><a href="#Make-users-pay-with-virtual-currency" class="headerlink" title="Make users pay with virtual currency"></a>Make users pay with virtual currency</h1><blockquote>
<p>If incense costs 80 pokecoins and a batch of 550 pokecoins costs $4.99, how much real money does incense cost? Yeah i don’t know either.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It is hard to determine the amount of money spent <em>and</em> the amount of virtual currency being spent, making micropayments seem virtual to stupid users.<br>Paying with virtual currency also has the advantage of bypassing the credit card.</p>
<h1 id="Make-some-rewards-more-ambiguous-than-others"><a href="#Make-some-rewards-more-ambiguous-than-others" class="headerlink" title="Make some rewards more ambiguous than others"></a>Make some rewards more ambiguous than others</h1><blockquote>
<p>It’s clever how you can only buy Lunchboxes so you don’t know what you’ll get out of them</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Some in-game items are purely gambling. Users will convince themselves than spending 880 Nexon cash (or whatever it’s called) is a good idea for buying a <a href="https://maplewiki.net/index.php?title=Gachapon" target="_blank" rel="external">“Gachapon”</a>, a lottery service that may or may not yield an in-game item more valuable than 880 currency units.</p>
<h1 id="Make-the-game-bad-then-allow-users-to-pay-to-make-it-good"><a href="#Make-the-game-bad-then-allow-users-to-pay-to-make-it-good" class="headerlink" title="Make the game bad, then allow users to pay to make it good"></a>Make the game bad, then allow users to pay to make it good</h1><p>“Bad” can mean many things; “good” often means convenience. Pay to lure more pokemon, pay to save progress at any time, pay to get a slightly better weapon. The game can still be played without payments, but it seems to users that they can simply pay to wipe the pain away.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>They have the incentives to insert pain points into the game.</p>
</blockquote>
<h1 id="Set-different-prices-for-different-players-and-features"><a href="#Set-different-prices-for-different-players-and-features" class="headerlink" title="Set different prices for different players and features"></a>Set different prices for different players and features</h1><p>Make tiers of bundles of coins to please the “whales”, who will spend far more on your game than the others.<br>Set different prices on different players, gather the purchase data, and see which prices work.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>If it seems like you’re about to quit, hey here’s a discount. Or if you’re the type of person who will spend a lot of money, maybe they bump up the prices a bit.</p>
