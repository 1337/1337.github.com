<p> I make my living talking to people.

    	<p>My landlord is letting his place go on sale. This also means my eviction is in order (and, given the reason, has a very generous notice required by law). It is time to revisit what it was like to live in an apartment, and what people with similar experiences gained/missed.</p>
<h1 id="Pros"><a href="#Pros" class="headerlink" title="Pros"></a>Pros</h1><ol>
<li>Stairs optional.</li>
<li>Parking is usually underground. With locks.</li>
<li>Gated entry guaranteed.</li>
<li>Usually more to see out of windows (unless you rent the basement)</li>
<li>Laundry en suite or in building is almost guaranteed.</li>
<li>There may be other amenities like a fitness room, grocery store, and even a pool. Excellent for people wanting/waiting to die here.</li>
<li>The power will probably never go out. If the power goes out, poor old grannies will be trapped, and they probably won’t let that happen.</li>
<li>No snow. No grass.</li>
</ol>
<h1 id="Cons"><a href="#Cons" class="headerlink" title="Cons"></a>Cons</h1><ol>
<li>You have to share the lift. And if anyone comes in, you have to pretend you know them and smile.</li>
<li>Possible noise from upstairs or downstairs.</li>
<li>Possible noise from the building itself (if central air)</li>
<li>Really troublesome to move in and out.</li>
<li>It takes minutes rather than seconds to leave the building. Add more time is driving your car out of that underground parking.</li>
<li>Mailboxes are small, and no one leaves your packages at your door. Because they can’t get to your door.</li>
<li>Setting off the smoke alarm might cause the entire building to evacuate.</li>
<li>No space for car washes.</li>
<li>Much higher likelihood of someone sniffing your packets and hacking your Wi-Fis.</li>
<li>Way more diseases.</li>
<li>No more sound of raindrops from the roof.</li>
</ol>

    	<p>My landlord is letting his place go on sale. This also means my eviction is in order (and, given the reason, has a very generous notice required by law). It is time to revisit what it was like to live alone, and what people with similar experiences gained/missed.</p>
<h1 id="Pros"><a href="#Pros" class="headerlink" title="Pros"></a>Pros</h1><ol>
<li>No one will ever touch your food.</li>
<li>The whole fridge is yours.</li>
<li>You can talk to yourself without anyone else thinking you are crazy.</li>
<li>Cleaning schedule is “whenever”.</li>
<li>No quiet hours (except otherwise specified by building).</li>
<li>No one touches your electrical appliances (if any), and they are always available to use. Wash your clothes at 3am if you want.</li>
<li>You can sing in the shower as poorly as your heart desires.</li>
<li>You are almost guaranteed more space per capita.</li>
<li>The door is where you put <em>your</em> shoes.</li>
<li>Thermostat is set by you. Air conditioning is set by you.</li>
<li>Your place may be eligible for 100% of the parking spots (which is usually one).</li>
<li>Can poop with door open. The stench is always your very own.</li>
<li>The bathroom is always free. Toilet paper lasts forever.</li>
<li><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/1z996r/what_are_some_of_the_perks_when_living_by_yourself/" target="_blank" rel="external">Everything is always where you left it.</a></li>
<li>You can have friends over any time.</li>
<li>You can be completely naked, anywhere, anytime. You can also <em>do</em> anything while naked, anywhere, anytime.</li>
<li>No one uses your soap. You can be sure your razor has not touched the testes of any man (or any other man).</li>
<li>All the Internet bandwidth belongs to you. Also, no one will hack you from the inside.</li>
<li>The sink can be used, perpetually, for soaking dishes that really needed soaking, rather than being called a lazy bastard every other hour.</li>
<li>You can keep various pets and plants with only your rental agreement and/or the law to worry about (where applicable).</li>
<li>You can choose <em>where</em> to sleep. You can sleep on the couch, the laundry room, or above the toilet bowl for all we care.</li>
<li>You can fill the entire house/apartment with cooking smoke and only you will be shamed of what you did.</li>
</ol>
<h1 id="Cons"><a href="#Cons" class="headerlink" title="Cons"></a>Cons</h1><ol>
<li>Appliances might not come as standard. May need to do your laundry elsewhere.</li>
<li>No noise made by other humans. Can be lonely.</li>
<li>You pay all bills not covered by the lease. This is less likely when living with others.</li>
<li>More expensive rent per capita. Sometimes also higher per unit area.</li>
<li>If anything squeaks and leaks or falls apart, you know you are the only person who could have broken it.</li>
<li>You are almost certainly guaranteed not to have a dishwasher. You might not even have a proper stove.</li>
<li>If anything is dirty, you are cleaning it. Though, you know you were the one dirtying it in the first place.</li>
<li>With no one to gauge your QOL, it is completely possible that you will become a social degenerate.</li>
<li>Inability to share 4L bags of milk.</li>
<li>You never carpool (except if you drive for Uber, maybe).</li>
<li>You never share the cost of your car.</li>
<li>No one will share their Netflix account with you.</li>
<li>If you have a pet, you and you alone must walk it.</li>
<li>You alone will defend the home intruder.</li>
<li>You can invite friends over only if you have the space. You might not have the space.</li>
<li>Losing keys can be a very costly ordeal.</li>
<li>No one to practice interviews with. Or talk to, on a daily basis.</li>
<li>If you torrent anything, they will know it is you.</li>
<li>Too much free space might pressure you to get all sorts of furniture you never needed.</li>
<li>You pay your own home insurance.</li>
<li>Snow? You are shovelling (where applicable). Grass? You might get away with paying a boy to cut it for you, but that also costs money.</li>
<li>It is less likely that you will find someone willing to help you move.</li>
<li>If you are a stroke or heart attack, you die.</li>
