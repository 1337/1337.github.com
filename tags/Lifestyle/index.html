    	<p>Unfortunately, when you <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=13735610" target="_blank" rel="external">ask a question like that on the Internet</a>, you will get more bad responses than good. Who <em>really</em> wants to read comments, anyway? Startup idea.</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Identify what you actually want in life.</strong><br>If you don’t even know what you want or what goals you have, there is no way you can be motivated to reach it.<blockquote>
<p>“If you really, really want or need something then there’s usually also enough motivation to work towards it.” - rsp1984</p>
</blockquote>
</li>
<li><strong>Make your own startup.</strong><br>If you aren’t afraid of failing, that is. If you really believe in bluetooth tentacle robots, go out there and blow everyone out of the water.</li>
<li><strong>Calm yourself down when stimulation is not appropriate.</strong><br>Learn to switch yourself off every day. This can come in the form of yoga, meditation, or offline reading. Allow yourself to wake up to another day refreshed and ready for anything.</li>
<li><strong>Get a non-tech hobby.</strong><br>Helps you switch off.<blockquote>
<p>“Drawing, painting, knitting, dancing, a sport, volunteering at an animal shelter, gourmet cooking, write a novel, learn a new language.”” - webmaven</p>
</blockquote>
</li>
<li><strong>Keep challenging yourself out of your comfort zone.</strong><br>Once you get used to something, you’ll be good at it, and once you’re good at it, for some reason, you’ll start liking it. Example: self-automation, PHP.</li>
<li><strong>Go on a trip.</strong><br>Trips help you find yourself. Maybe you want to be a scuba diving instructor, not a programmer. Maybe you want to sell designer handbags for a living. Or do social work. Or design fireworks. Or become a priest. Talk to these people, and see what their lives are like.</li>
<li><strong>Take some vitamins.</strong><br>A lack of energy can occasionally be explained by a lack of vitamin D.</li>
<li><strong>Find new work.</strong><br>Maybe your work hours are too long. Or maybe the people you work with are bringing you down. Example: that loser Brian from work who always picks on your use of punctuation.</li>

    	<p>My landlord is letting his place go on sale. This also means my eviction is in order (and, given the reason, has a very generous notice required by law). It is time to revisit what it was like to live alone, and what people with similar experiences gained/missed.</p>
<h1 id="Pros"><a href="#Pros" class="headerlink" title="Pros"></a>Pros</h1><ol>
<li>No one will ever touch your food.</li>
<li>The whole fridge is yours.</li>
<li>You can talk to yourself without anyone else thinking you are crazy.</li>
<li>Cleaning schedule is “whenever”.</li>
<li>No quiet hours (except otherwise specified by building).</li>
<li>No one touches your electrical appliances (if any), and they are always available to use. Wash your clothes at 3am if you want.</li>
<li>You can sing in the shower as poorly as your heart desires.</li>
<li>You are almost guaranteed more space per capita.</li>
<li>The door is where you put <em>your</em> shoes.</li>
<li>Thermostat is set by you. Air conditioning is set by you.</li>
<li>Your place may be eligible for 100% of the parking spots (which is usually one).</li>
<li>Can poop with door open. The stench is always your very own.</li>
<li>The bathroom is always free. Toilet paper lasts forever.</li>
<li><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/1z996r/what_are_some_of_the_perks_when_living_by_yourself/" target="_blank" rel="external">Everything is always where you left it.</a></li>
<li>You can have friends over any time.</li>
<li>You can be completely naked, anywhere, anytime. You can also <em>do</em> anything while naked, anywhere, anytime.</li>
<li>No one uses your soap. You can be sure your razor has not touched the testes of any man (or any other man).</li>
<li>All the Internet bandwidth belongs to you. Also, no one will hack you from the inside.</li>
<li>The sink can be used, perpetually, for soaking dishes that really needed soaking, rather than being called a lazy bastard every other hour.</li>
<li>You can keep various pets and plants with only your rental agreement and/or the law to worry about (where applicable).</li>
<li>You can choose <em>where</em> to sleep. You can sleep on the couch, the laundry room, or above the toilet bowl for all we care.</li>
<li>You can fill the entire house/apartment with cooking smoke and only you will be shamed of what you did.</li>
</ol>
<h1 id="Cons"><a href="#Cons" class="headerlink" title="Cons"></a>Cons</h1><ol>
<li>Appliances might not come as standard. May need to do your laundry elsewhere.</li>
<li>No noise made by other humans. Can be lonely.</li>
<li>You pay all bills not covered by the lease. This is less likely when living with others.</li>
<li>More expensive rent per capita. Sometimes also higher per unit area.</li>
<li>If anything squeaks and leaks or falls apart, you know you are the only person who could have broken it.</li>
<li>You are almost certainly guaranteed not to have a dishwasher. You might not even have a proper stove.</li>
<li>If anything is dirty, you are cleaning it. Though, you know you were the one dirtying it in the first place.</li>
<li>With no one to gauge your QOL, it is completely possible that you will become a social degenerate.</li>
<li>Inability to share 4L bags of milk.</li>
<li>You never carpool (except if you drive for Uber, maybe).</li>
<li>You never share the cost of your car.</li>
<li>No one will share their Netflix account with you.</li>
<li>If you have a pet, you and you alone must walk it.</li>
<li>You alone will defend the home intruder.</li>
<li>You can invite friends over only if you have the space. You might not have the space.</li>
<li>Losing keys can be a very costly ordeal.</li>
<li>No one to practice interviews with. Or talk to, on a daily basis.</li>
<li>If you torrent anything, they will know it is you.</li>
<li>Too much free space might pressure you to get all sorts of furniture you never needed.</li>
<li>You pay your own home insurance.</li>
<li>Snow? You are shovelling (where applicable). Grass? You might get away with paying a boy to cut it for you, but that also costs money.</li>
<li>It is less likely that you will find someone willing to help you move.</li>
<li>If you are a stroke or heart attack, you die.</li>
