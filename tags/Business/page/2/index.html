    	<p>Suppose you are in your twenties to mid fourties, have some money to play with, and have no kids. (If you happen to be married, congratulations! <a href="http://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/dinks.asp" target="_blank" rel="external">The society wants your money and they want you dead</a>) What do you do with your money? Under heavy paternal influence, I spent some of it in the stock market.</p>
<h2 id="My-one-rule-have-money"><a href="#My-one-rule-have-money" class="headerlink" title="My one rule: have money"></a><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZzTV0G6wZJM" target="_blank" rel="external">My one rule</a>: have money</h2><p>This is Investment 001, the article aimed at people who have a pile of cash, don’t know what to do with it, and would rather buy a nice, 60-inch smart TV for the living room than putting the money to good use. (If you don’t have the money to invest with, what are you investing?)</p>
<h2 id="My-other-one-rule-know-what-you-are-doing"><a href="#My-other-one-rule-know-what-you-are-doing" class="headerlink" title="My other one rule: know what you are doing"></a>My other one rule: know what you are doing</h2><p>If there’s anything my mother taught me, it is that the key to anything is practice. As a mother, she knew how to do things, and do things right.</p>
<p>Here you are, on this blog, wondering how to get started; it has occurred to you that it is near impossible to just “get started”, or google “<a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=how+to+get+started+in+investing" target="_blank" rel="external">how to get started in investing</a>“ because the results are different for everyone. As a son of a mother, the first thing I learned to do was knowing what you are doing before doing what you will do.</p>
<h2 id="Which-one-should-I-buy-WOSIB"><a href="#Which-one-should-I-buy-WOSIB" class="headerlink" title="Which one should I buy (WOSIB)?"></a>Which one should I buy (WOSIB)?</h2><ul>
<li>If you have more than $10000000 to invest in, consider bribing your local government with lobbyists.</li>
<li>If you have more than $1000000 to invest in, consider buying a <em>house</em> near a freshwater lake.</li>
<li>If you have less than $100 to invest in, consider buying some weights and protein shakes from Wal-mart for mad gains.</li>
<li>If you have any other amount of money, consider buying <em>stocks, bonds, and mutual funds</em>.</li>
<li>If you don’t know how much you have, consider buying just mutual funds.</li>
</ul>
<p>A house, also known as <strong>property</strong> in this industry, are usually houses that you <em>don’t</em> live in. If you live in a house, it is called a <strong>liability</strong> (because you are in it, you cannot sell it, and as long as you are in it, it will only wear out.) <strong>Stocks</strong> are fractions of a company that you can buy. The moment you buy your first stock, you are a shareholder! A very small shareholder. <strong>Bonds</strong> are like stocks, but instead of companies, you buy the government’s debts. The government “borrows money from you”, agreeing to give you a bit more in return. <strong>Mutual funds</strong> are a mix of any of the above, managed by one or more <em>managers</em>, who typically know(s) better.</p>
<p>When you buy which depends on the state of the market. For example, if a recession is going on, stocks are likely dropping in prices, and you should be careful buying or selling them.</p>
<ul>
<li>Consider buying stocks in a <em>bull market</em>: a market where people are starting to gain confidence in investing.</li>
<li>Never buy stocks in a <em>bear market</em>: a market whose general prices are falling, and people are being pessimistic.</li>
<li>Consider buying mutual funds if you really don’t care, or some houses to rent out if you have a pile of money, <em>and</em> really don’t care.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="My-other-one-rule-don’t-lose-any-money"><a href="#My-other-one-rule-don’t-lose-any-money" class="headerlink" title="My other one rule: don’t lose any money"></a>My other one rule: don’t lose any money</h2><p>The first thing I learned about investing is that you shouldn’t be losing any money; this is invariably true. Anything your wife calls “investments”, such as that new dress or that new car, are not investments. They are not investments because they don’t earn you any money (unless you travel with that car to places where you earn money–and even then, this definition is debatable.) Not losing anything money is particularly hard when inflation is factored in, where <em>not investing</em> is a net loss of 3% per month. Therefore, the key to success in investing is to figure out how not to lose any money – a story for another day.</p>
<h2 id="Disclaimer"><a href="#Disclaimer" class="headerlink" title="Disclaimer"></a>Disclaimer</h2><p>I am just someone you read about on the Internet. Do not believe in everything I say. Make your own decisions.</p>
