    	<p>Startups (start-ups) are hard.</p>
<p>You are the CEO of <em>QuickHolland</em>, a company that sells instant hollandaise sauce (currently in R&amp;D) in revolutionary, squeeze-bottle form factor.</p>
<p>As a founder in a startup, you likely have several priorities to juggle:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Maintaining your vision</strong>, because it is <em>your</em> company</li>
<li><strong>Maintaining investor relations</strong>, to get advice from them (if they are on the board) or to have a constant source of funding</li>
<li><strong>Managing your day-to-day business</strong>, because, again, this company is yours to run.</li>
</ol>
<p>This post explains why it is often difficult to do all of these things.</p>
<h2 id="1-Maintaining-your-vision"><a href="#1-Maintaining-your-vision" class="headerlink" title="1. Maintaining your vision"></a>1. Maintaining your vision</h2><p>Your mother just spent an hour <a href="http://ciaoegrazie.wordpress.com/tag/gordon-ramsays-hollandaise-sauce/" target="_blank" rel="external">making hollandaise sauce from scratch</a>, and she complains to you that it was too time-consuming a thing to do in the morning–when people need to get to work on time.</p>
<p>You have an idea; a lightbulb glowed atop your head. Instant hollandaise sauce. You narrow your vision. You set your goal. You incorporate your company. And you hire on the best people you know.</p>
<p>Now what?</p>
<p><strong>Is it your job to stick to the vision, or is it sometimes appropriate to modify the company’s vision?</strong></p>
<p>One year into your saucy enterprise, you find yourself in a sticky situation, where your food scientists come up with something in a squeeze bottle, but no one is buying it. “But build it and they will come,” you think to yourself, “maybe I am not reaching the correct market.”</p>
<p>You pitch your idea to your investors and they say that your idea reeks of unoriginality. They say that it has been done before. “Is this like other hollandaise sauces out there, except <del>on social networks</del>in a squeeze bottle?” You tell them yes, but, see, the squeeze bottle is what we’re <em>really</em> selling. Your investors, agreeing with your explanation, throw money at you for another year of runway.</p>
<p><strong>Are you now selling hollandaise sauce, or are you now selling squeeze bottles?</strong></p>
<p>You go back to your team of scientists and tell them you have decided to <em>pivot</em>. To pivot is to change the direction of the company–your corporate vision has now changed. Half of your team leaves your company because they are food scientists, not petroleum engineers (who would be the people who commonly make squeeze bottles). “No matter,” you think to yourself, “I have <em>leads</em>.”</p>
<h2 id="2-Maintaining-investor-relations"><a href="#2-Maintaining-investor-relations" class="headerlink" title="2. Maintaining investor relations"></a>2. Maintaining investor relations</h2><p>You own 100% of the company, but you need some initial funding, so the first course of action, of course, is to ask family and friends for your “bootstrap” money. That money buys you time, the ability to pay lawyers and governments for business-related fees, and money to hire your first employee.</p>
<p>Of course, you will almost certainly want to hire more than one employee, so you sell your company’s <em>shares</em>, to your investors (wherever you got hold of them to begin with), for instant funding, paid back by them as <em>convertible notes</em>. With that capital, you hire your second, third, fourth employees, and so on. You know how long your <em>runway</em> is (how much money you have {div} how much money you spend per month), and so do your investors, because they request that kind of information. They give you funding because they know you have a team who can execute your idea. They give you funding because you seem like a competent leader. They give you funding because, ultimately, your company might succeed, which means more money for them.</p>
<p><strong>What if you don’t succeed?</strong></p>
<h2 id="3-Managing-your-day-to-day-business"><a href="#3-Managing-your-day-to-day-business" class="headerlink" title="3. Managing your day-to-day business"></a>3. Managing your day-to-day business</h2><p><em>QuickHolland</em> is your first business, and it is your baby. By now, you have been working on it for three years, and you have pivoted three times so far; your company now prints posters for supermarkets that sell your brilliant squeeze bottles, turning your company into an advertising agency. You still have your brilliant team of people, but only one food scientist is left at this point, because the company isn’t really making food anymore.</p>
<p>On your fourth year, you run out of funding (which is a surprising amount of time, because investors gave you only one year’s worth of money.) You cannot pay your employees for the time being, but, no matter, this too shall pass. You try very hard to look for new investors. You get about half a year worth of runway, yet again, saving the company once more.</p>
<p><strong>Are you going to pay your employees their unsettled wages? If so, how?</strong></p>
<p>Once, while swimming in Salt Lake, you encounter a young, attractive woman, who happens to be interested in you. You two share the same interests, same backgrounds, and quickly fall in love. Once she moves in, You quickly realise that you no longer have the time and patience to run and maintain the company that was once your baby and vision. Hell, it isn’t even what your mother asked for anymore.</p>
<p><strong>What comes first? Your life, or your company?</strong></p>

    	<p>Suppose you are in your twenties to mid fourties, have some money to play with, and have no kids. (If you happen to be married, congratulations! <a href="http://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/dinks.asp" target="_blank" rel="external">The society wants your money and they want you dead</a>) What do you do with your money? Under heavy paternal influence, I spent some of it in the stock market.</p>
<h2 id="My-one-rule-have-money"><a href="#My-one-rule-have-money" class="headerlink" title="My one rule: have money"></a><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZzTV0G6wZJM" target="_blank" rel="external">My one rule</a>: have money</h2><p>This is Investment 001, the article aimed at people who have a pile of cash, don’t know what to do with it, and would rather buy a nice, 60-inch smart TV for the living room than putting the money to good use. (If you don’t have the money to invest with, what are you investing?)</p>
<h2 id="My-other-one-rule-know-what-you-are-doing"><a href="#My-other-one-rule-know-what-you-are-doing" class="headerlink" title="My other one rule: know what you are doing"></a>My other one rule: know what you are doing</h2><p>If there’s anything my mother taught me, it is that the key to anything is practice. As a mother, she knew how to do things, and do things right.</p>
<p>Here you are, on this blog, wondering how to get started; it has occurred to you that it is near impossible to just “get started”, or google “<a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=how+to+get+started+in+investing" target="_blank" rel="external">how to get started in investing</a>“ because the results are different for everyone. As a son of a mother, the first thing I learned to do was knowing what you are doing before doing what you will do.</p>
<h2 id="Which-one-should-I-buy-WOSIB"><a href="#Which-one-should-I-buy-WOSIB" class="headerlink" title="Which one should I buy (WOSIB)?"></a>Which one should I buy (WOSIB)?</h2><ul>
<li>If you have more than $10000000 to invest in, consider bribing your local government with lobbyists.</li>
<li>If you have more than $1000000 to invest in, consider buying a <em>house</em> near a freshwater lake.</li>
<li>If you have less than $100 to invest in, consider buying some weights and protein shakes from Wal-mart for mad gains.</li>
<li>If you have any other amount of money, consider buying <em>stocks, bonds, and mutual funds</em>.</li>
<li>If you don’t know how much you have, consider buying just mutual funds.</li>
</ul>
<p>A house, also known as <strong>property</strong> in this industry, are usually houses that you <em>don’t</em> live in. If you live in a house, it is called a <strong>liability</strong> (because you are in it, you cannot sell it, and as long as you are in it, it will only wear out.) <strong>Stocks</strong> are fractions of a company that you can buy. The moment you buy your first stock, you are a shareholder! A very small shareholder. <strong>Bonds</strong> are like stocks, but instead of companies, you buy the government’s debts. The government “borrows money from you”, agreeing to give you a bit more in return. <strong>Mutual funds</strong> are a mix of any of the above, managed by one or more <em>managers</em>, who typically know(s) better.</p>
<p>When you buy which depends on the state of the market. For example, if a recession is going on, stocks are likely dropping in prices, and you should be careful buying or selling them.</p>
<ul>
<li>Consider buying stocks in a <em>bull market</em>: a market where people are starting to gain confidence in investing.</li>
<li>Never buy stocks in a <em>bear market</em>: a market whose general prices are falling, and people are being pessimistic.</li>
<li>Consider buying mutual funds if you really don’t care, or some houses to rent out if you have a pile of money, <em>and</em> really don’t care.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="My-other-one-rule-don’t-lose-any-money"><a href="#My-other-one-rule-don’t-lose-any-money" class="headerlink" title="My other one rule: don’t lose any money"></a>My other one rule: don’t lose any money</h2><p>The first thing I learned about investing is that you shouldn’t be losing any money; this is invariably true. Anything your wife calls “investments”, such as that new dress or that new car, are not investments. They are not investments because they don’t earn you any money (unless you travel with that car to places where you earn money–and even then, this definition is debatable.) Not losing anything money is particularly hard when inflation is factored in, where <em>not investing</em> is a net loss of 3% per month. Therefore, the key to success in investing is to figure out how not to lose any money – a story for another day.</p>
<h2 id="Disclaimer"><a href="#Disclaimer" class="headerlink" title="Disclaimer"></a>Disclaimer</h2><p>I am just someone you read about on the Internet. Do not believe in everything I say. Make your own decisions.</p>
