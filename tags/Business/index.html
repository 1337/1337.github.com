<li>Dude tells another Dude, also called Dude, about this problem. Dude agrees and is equally passionate about fixing the issue. New Business (Dude and Dude Co., DD) is created.</li>

<li>DD shows investors this problem they would like to solve.</li>
<li>DD gets the funding and solves the problem flawlessly. Business traction grows as word of mouth goes viral. “DD is a miracle,” say newspapers, blogs, youtube channels. “Just get DD,” “Top 10 tools to solve X in 2017.”</li>
<li>DD gets bought by Facebook.</li>
<li>Problem X comes back after DD.FB decide to monetise the hell out of the solution after crippling it for “new and improved enterprise pricing.”</li>

She kept her ex-husband’s last name because it is more valuable. One day, she decided to write a 300-page book, with the intention to make it an interesting read, rather than writing a handy reference. This is the handy reference.</p>
<h1 id="You-never-really-know-a-company-until-you-own-part-of-it"><a href="#You-never-really-know-a-company-until-you-own-part-of-it" class="headerlink" title="You never really know a company until you own part of it"></a>You never really know a company until you own part of it</h1><blockquote>
<p>“W never [seemed to look] at the stock charts, and thought “<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Efficient-market_hypothesis" target="_blank" rel="external">Efficient Market Theory</a>“ was rubbish. He acted as if the entire stock market didn’t exist, paying attention only to the individual businesses he was interested in owning.” - Actually a rephrased quote</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Other people’s folly, and W’s discipline, are the two key elements of W’s investing philosophy. W invests only when it makes sense from the <em>business perspective</em>. When the market drops, W buys. When the market soars, he stops investing on companies that have no hope for ROI.</p>
<h2 id="Screening-tips"><a href="#Screening-tips" class="headerlink" title="Screening tips"></a>Screening tips</h2><ol>
<li>W buys only when the business is being sold reasonable to its <strong>intrinsic value</strong>, and whether the business will have a high <strong>future value</strong> in 10 years. What are intrinsic value and future value? <em>W only makes long-term investments in companies whose future earnings have a high degree of predictability.</em> This minimises risk. If earnings aren’t predictable, then investing is mere speculation. And W does not do that.</li>
<li>Companies whose earnings can be reasonably predicted are the ones that have good “business economics” working in their favour. They can either buy new businesses to improve their profitability, or improve their existing cash cows. These companies have high <a href="http://www.investopedia.com/terms/r/returnonequity.asp" target="_blank" rel="external">ROE</a>, strong earnings, <strong>consumer monopoly</strong>, and operations that provide shareholder value.<br>1.Buy low, sell only when there is lower “business economics” than when you bought it.</li>
<li>First identify good companies, then wait for the prices to drop. Don’t do it the other way around.</li>
</ol>
<h1 id="Investing-from-a-business-perspective"><a href="#Investing-from-a-business-perspective" class="headerlink" title="Investing from a business perspective"></a>Investing from a business perspective</h1><p>“Investing from a business perspective” teaches you what <em>not</em> to buy.</p>
<p>Signs that you are doing it right:</p>
<ul>
<li>You wait for the market to go down rather than up, using that time to look up companies to own.</li>
<li>You don’t expect (your) stock prices to go up in a week.</li>
<li>Rather than looking at the prices, you learn to invest in companies that give you decent returns in the long term.</li>
<li>You find diversification unnecessary. (Diversification is a means to protect yourself from stupidity, not because you are smart.)</li>
<li>You find cheap stocks expensive, but expensive stocks cheap.</li>
</ul>
<h1 id="Investment-is-most-intelligent-when-it-is-most-businesslike"><a href="#Investment-is-most-intelligent-when-it-is-most-businesslike" class="headerlink" title="Investment is most intelligent when it is most businesslike"></a>Investment is most intelligent when it is most businesslike</h1><p>The numbers are [relatively] useless. You are owning a company; you need to look at the business.</p>
<p>The easiest way to do this (a “buy an excellent business that makes business sense”) is by looking at the long term value of the company, rather than the price of it now. A 100,000-dollar drug store with 20,000-dollar yearly earnings is an annual return of 20%. Then you compare that 20% with other offerings in the same industry, and find the best company to join.</p>
<h1 id="W’s-view-on-earnings"><a href="#W’s-view-on-earnings" class="headerlink" title="W’s view on earnings"></a>W’s view on earnings</h1><ul>
<li>Good companies don’t need to pay dividends if the company reinvesting that money can yield a greater return [on price/value]. Berkshire Hathaway trades at 2xx,000 (right now) and does not give out any dividends.</li>
</ul>
<h1 id="The-price-you-pay-determines-your-rate-of-return"><a href="#The-price-you-pay-determines-your-rate-of-return" class="headerlink" title="The price you pay determines your rate of return"></a>The price you pay determines your rate of return</h1><p>The future value of a stock is $FV = PV \cdot (1 + i)^n$ , where <em>i</em> is your rate of return (usually earnings per share per year), and <em>n</em> is the number of years you hold onto it. So, to determine a good time to buy you stock, just <a href="http://www.investopedia.com/walkthrough/corporate-finance/3/time-value-money/present-value-discounting.aspx" target="_blank" rel="external">reverse the formula</a> and solve for <em>PV</em>.</p>
<p>You will find that <em>i</em> varies year to year, so that’s where the <em>high degree of predictability</em> thing comes in. A high degree of predictability lets you do such a calculation.</p>
<p><strong>Note</strong>: an <em>i</em> of greater than 8% is meaningful. The difference between 14% -&gt; 15% (30% difference over 20 years) is far greater than 13% -&gt; 14% (22% difference over 20 years).</p>
<h1 id="What-to-buy-and-what-price"><a href="#What-to-buy-and-what-price" class="headerlink" title="What to buy, and what price"></a>What to buy, and what price</h1><p>It is never what analysts say. Salesmen never get you a bargain for no reason.</p>
<p>“What to buy, and what price” are the only two things you need to know. <strong>They are independent questions</strong>, but W likes to first look at what he wants to buy, then wait for them to go on sale (Warren), rather than buying whatever is on sale (Graham).</p>
<h1 id="The-magic-of-compounding"><a href="#The-magic-of-compounding" class="headerlink" title="The magic of compounding"></a>The magic of compounding</h1><p>The rate of return <em>needs</em> to be high. A difference between a 15% and 16% is very, very high compounded over 30 years (196,000 dollars of difference, if you start with 10,000 dollars) If you compare 15% with 20%, you get $1,700,000 more. Every single percent counts.</p>

<h1 id="The-theory-of-an-expanding-intrinsic-value"><a href="#The-theory-of-an-expanding-intrinsic-value" class="headerlink" title="The theory of an expanding intrinsic value"></a>The theory of an expanding intrinsic value</h1><p>As a company’s earnings <em>and</em> profitability increase, then its <a href="http://www.money-zine.com/calculators/investment-calculators/intrinsic-value-and-roi-calculator/" target="_blank" rel="external">intrinsic value</a> also rises. IV is however much worth of bonds is required to get the same amount of earnings per share that year. Chapter 34 explains how exactly to calculate intrinsic value.</p>
<p>The company’s IV might eventually be lower than its stock price. If the business has long term revenue, then the stock price will eventually increase to match its IV. Otherwise, it is fine to sell when the IV is lower than its stock price.</p>

<p>“A mediocre business will more than likely remain mediocre” [and have its stock value go nowhere]</p>
</blockquote>
<h1 id="The-mediocre-business"><a href="#The-mediocre-business" class="headerlink" title="The mediocre business"></a>The mediocre business</h1><p>There are two types of business: <em>commodity businesses</em> (paper, gas, oil, textiles, stuff like that) and <em>excellent businesses</em>. Excellent businesses have what W calls <em>consumer monopoly</em>.</p>
<p>Commodity businesses “sell things that a lot of others are selling.” They operate on the principle of low price. They also have erratic year-to-year profits (if any), and rarely provide good returns because of it.</p>
<h1 id="How-to-identify-the-excellent-business"><a href="#How-to-identify-the-excellent-business" class="headerlink" title="How to identify the excellent business"></a>How to identify the excellent business</h1><p>Example: toll bridge. You can’t not pay the toll bridge. Toll bridges are consumer monopolies.<br>Example: towns with only one newspaper. You can’t not advertise on that newspaper (not that good of an example).</p>
<h1 id="Nine-questions-to-help-you-determine-if-a-business-is-truly-an-excellent-one"><a href="#Nine-questions-to-help-you-determine-if-a-business-is-truly-an-excellent-one" class="headerlink" title="Nine questions to help you determine if a business is truly an excellent one"></a>Nine questions to help you determine if a business is truly an excellent one</h1><ol>
<li><strong>Does the business have an identifiable consumer monopoly?</strong><br>For products, this can usually be answered by going to any store, and asking <em>“what brand-name products would the store manager be insane not to carry?”</em></li>
<li><strong>Are the earnings of the company strong and showing an upward trend?</strong><br>Not only should they all be positive, they should be increasing.<br>You can find this information somewhere on the Internet.</li>
<li><strong>Is the company conservatively financed?</strong><br>These companies should have no debt.<br>They should also be out of the commodity sector.</li>
<li><strong>Does the business consistently earn a high rate of return on shareholders’ equity (<a href="http://www.investopedia.com/terms/r/returnonequity.asp" target="_blank" rel="external">ROE</a>)?</strong><br><em>Consistently</em> was italicised.<br>ROE is the “your bang for the buck” factor. It reflects how well the companies use your money to make more money.</li>
<li><strong>Does the business get to retain its earnings?</strong><br>Although it disappoints you as a person, businesses can reinvest any money that isn’t given out as dividends, improving processes or acquiring companies, making it more successful in the long run.</li>
<li><strong>How much does the business have to spend on maintaining current operations?</strong><br>This can often mean the company makes products that rarely go obsolete, and rarely require equipment replacements, high cost of R&amp;D. W’s example was Thompson Publishing, a newspaper company.</li>
<li><strong>Is the company free to reinvest retained earnings in the new business opportunities, expansion of operations, or share repurchases? How good a job does the management do at this?</strong><br>“Look at the management”. The C something Os should be researched.</li>
<li><strong>Is the company free to adjust prices to inflation?</strong><br>The example was airline companies. Even though inflation brought higher costs, the ticket prices had to be kept low to remain competitive. They are not good investment companies.</li>
<li><strong>Will the value added by retained earnings increase the market value of the company?</strong><br>This adds to the compounding effect on returns.</li>
</ol>
<h1 id="Where-to-look-for-excellent-businesses"><a href="#Where-to-look-for-excellent-businesses" class="headerlink" title="Where to look for excellent businesses"></a>Where to look for excellent businesses</h1><ol>
<li><strong>Businesses making products that are used up fast or wear out quickly, have brand name appeal, and that merchants have to keep selling to stay in business</strong><br>This is the toll bridge of products. Merchants need to pay “the toll” to attract customers.<br>Examples: coca cola, pepsi, marlboro. Note that pepsi makes Doritos, and that has brand name appeal.</li>
<li><strong>Businesses that provide a repetitive service manufacturers must use to persuade the public to buy their products</strong><br>This is the toll bridge of doing business.<br>Examples: TV networks, ad agencies.</li>
<li><strong>Businesses that provide repetitive consumer services tht people and businesses are consistently in need of</strong><br>Examples: Pest control, cleaning/maid service, tax services.<br>These companies do not sell products that go obsolete, and do not require much equipment upgrade to stay competitive.</li>
</ol>

These products should be readily needed (and therefore purchased), and should not become obsolete over time.</p>
<p>It is best if you can start from your own field of work.</p>
<p><del>Sometimes you need to phone companies up to get their annual reports. Maybe they don’t trade publicly. That’s fine. Look up their phone number from the package, call them up, give them your address, and they will send you a copy for free.</del></p>
<h2 id="The-scuttlebutt-approach"><a href="#The-scuttlebutt-approach" class="headerlink" title="The scuttlebutt approach"></a>The <em>scuttlebutt approach</em></h2><p>If you don’t know a lot about the company, then Philip Fisher recommends in <em>Common Stocks and Uncommon Profits</em> that you simply call the company’s competition, or customers of the company’s competition, about the company in question. Sort of like having a coffee date with someone’s ex.</p>
<p>You can also ask store <em>managers</em> (no smalltalkers) how some of their products are selling.</p>
<h1 id="What-you-need-to-know-about-the-management-of-the-company-you-may-invest-in"><a href="#What-you-need-to-know-about-the-management-of-the-company-you-may-invest-in" class="headerlink" title="What you need to know about the management of the company you may invest in"></a>What you need to know about the management of the company you may invest in</h1><p>You entrust your money to the management of the business. In order for that to work out for you, either:</p>
<ul>
<li>the management are not idiots; or</li>
<li>the business is so simple that even idiots can run it profitably. (W likes these kinds of businesses)</li>
</ul>
<p>Good managers treat the company like they own it. They act like owners. They are open and honest to shareholders. <em>They <a href="http://www.investopedia.com/articles/02/041702.asp" target="_blank" rel="external">buy back stocks</a> if it makes business sense for them to do so.</em> (It improves figures like ROA and ROE, as well as the stock price.)</p>

Then their stock prices do down, often violently. At this point, if you want to buy/sell, remember that <em>given good management, the company will likely at a better place than what it was before.</em> In that case, buy the dip / just don’t sell.</p>
<h1 id="How-market-mechanics-whipsaw-stock-prices-to-create-buying-opportunities"><a href="#How-market-mechanics-whipsaw-stock-prices-to-create-buying-opportunities" class="headerlink" title="How market mechanics whipsaw stock prices to create buying opportunities"></a>How market mechanics whipsaw stock prices to create buying opportunities</h1><p>When the price goes down, people sell. This makes the price worse. More people sell. There were panics in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Panic_of_1901" target="_blank" rel="external">1901</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_Monday_(1987)" target="_blank" rel="external">1987</a>. This creates opportunities for you to buy.</p>
<h1 id="Inflation"><a href="#Inflation" class="headerlink" title="Inflation"></a>Inflation</h1><p>Paper money used to represent a specific amount of gold, but since that concept went away, governments were free to print however much paper money they want. Thus inflation.</p>
<p>W believes inflation will always continue because deflation is political suicide for anyone who proposes it (think of mortgages. They are fixed payments, which are easier to pay when inflation takes place.)</p>
<h1 id="Inflation-and-consumer-monopoly"><a href="#Inflation-and-consumer-monopoly" class="headerlink" title="Inflation and consumer monopoly"></a>Inflation and consumer monopoly</h1><p>Inflation is generally bad for businesses, but because businesses with consumer monopoly have low operating cost, they generally gain relative competitive edge when, say, inflation doubles the prices of both the costs and products.</p>

<p>W finds bear and bull markets impossible to predict, so his solution is to ignore it [for his existing investments]. When a bear actually arrived, he bought some Coca-cola.</p>

<p>It is hard to determine the amount of money spent <em>and</em> the amount of virtual currency being spent, making micropayments seem virtual to stupid users.<br>Paying with virtual currency also has the advantage of bypassing the credit card.</p>

    	<p>As a mobile developer (if I can be called as such), I download competitor apps for business intelligence. This weekend, I downloaded <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.sdu.didi.psnger" target="_blank" rel="external">Didi Kuaidi</a>, whose <a href="http://fortune.com/2016/05/06/didi-kuaidi-funding/" target="_blank" rel="external">company</a> has exceeded Uber China’s market cap threefold ($25B vs $8B).</p>
<p>With this sort of market cap, they must have hired hundreds of thousands of smart Chinese developers to make a killer Android app, right? As it turns out, any question I ask here can be answered with ‘no.’</p>
<p>First thing after opening the app–which required more than a page of permissions to install–you are greeted with “Do you want to update?”</p>
<p><img src="/image/Screenshot_20160507-085649.png" alt="But I just downloaded the app!"></p>
<p>A stroke of genius from them: since Google Play Services is not that common in China, people there turn on “allow installations from unknown sources”, which allows/forces apps to update themselves like this.</p>
<p><img src="/image/Screenshot_20160507-085428.png" alt="Chinese apps download their own APKs"></p>
<p>After you update, you get this glorious map of sooty Beijing:</p>
<p><img src="/image/Screenshot_20160507-090027.png" alt="Sooty Beijing"><br><img src="/image/Screenshot_20160507-090204.png" alt="Not so sooty"></p>
<p>Why the map centers at Beijing, it is simple: the company is headquartered there. Why, then, can a startup 1/1000 of that size not have to have its app simply center its map in Toronto by default, is mind-boggling.<br>The app also does not try to obtain the user’s location, which is presumably where most trips would start.</p>
<p>I have received many, <em>many</em> complaints about the map (in my app, whichever one you think it is) being slow, and we just <em>need</em> to fix, optimise, and make it pretty. Well, look at this $25B map:</p>
<p><img src="/image/Screenshot_20160507-090213.png" alt="Slow map"></p>
<p>The map is some sort of custom Google Maps (or a very close imitation of it), which highlights the regions in which Didi Kuaidi offers service. I like that. Instead of doing just that, I have decided to disappoint my users <em>after</em> they perform a search. This allows me to generate a “demand heat map” with these failed searches.</p>
<p><img src="/image/Screenshot_20160507-090237.png" alt="Service areas"></p>
<p>There are many cute intro screens when you try to access the “UberPool of China”. I like those too.</p>
<p><img src="/image/Screenshot_20160507-090248.png" alt="Intro"><br><img src="/image/Screenshot_20160507-090258.png" alt="Intro"></p>
<p>Just when you think you are about done looking through this app, and would like to check the ‘Activity Centre’ to see what’s new. And lo, in all its glory:</p>
<p><img src="/image/Screenshot_20160507-090459.png" alt="What the shit is this"></p>
<p>It is then when I finally realised:<br><strong>Nobody cares about your stupid app. <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=site%3Areddit.com+finally+material+design" target="_blank" rel="external">Nobody cares if it is polished.</a> All it needs to do is work.</strong></p>

    	<p>Ever had your friend proofread your thesis, and all you got for comments are things like “missing Oxford comma here” or “I think this word should be underlined”? As it turns out, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parkinson%27s_law_of_triviality" target="_blank" rel="external">there is a term for that: bikeshedding</a>!</p>
<p>Bikeshedding describes the amount of time people spend on trivial things versus the non-trivial. Naturally, one <em>ought to</em> spend more time on the non-trivial because they are more difficult to understand; however, because so many people know about the trivial, they argue, over and over, about them. About the unimportant.</p>
<p>Wikipedia has <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Avoid_Parkinson%27s_Bicycle_Shed_Effect" target="_blank" rel="external">its own meta article about its articles</a> warning its editors against arguing about the trivial.</p>
<p>Bikeshed.com, a domain dedicated to this phenomenon, contains a sweet quote:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“The really, really short answer is that you should not. The somewhat longer answer is that just because you are capable of building a bikeshed does not mean you should stop others from building one just because you do not like the color they plan to paint it. This is a metaphor indicating that you need not argue about every little feature just because you know enough to do so. Some people have commented that the amount of noise generated by a change is inversely proportional to the complexity of the change.” - <a href="http://bikeshed.com/" target="_blank" rel="external">bikeshed.com</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p><a href="http://meta.stackexchange.com/questions/31253/the-bikeshed-problem-and-stack-exchange" target="_blank" rel="external">Some people</a> argue that the trivial is not what the argument is about; many people believe that the argument is actually about game theory between the relative knowledge of the writer and the reader, while others think the ratio between trivial and non-trivial should strike a perfect balance to get the most out of a review.</p>
<p>To this day, I am still unsure how to tackle this problem at my workplace.</p>
