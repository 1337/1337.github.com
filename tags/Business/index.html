<p>The first thing these games do is set up a virtual currency so that it doesn’t feel like you’re spending real currency, even though you are.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Ask users to buy “coins” and “gold” with credit card, and never make the conversion rate easy, like 1 gold: 1 cent. Make it hard for the user to realise how much was actually spent.</p>
<h1 id="Don’t-make-users-feel-like-they-are-paying-with-real-money"><a href="#Don’t-make-users-feel-like-they-are-paying-with-real-money" class="headerlink" title="Don’t make users feel like they are paying with real money"></a>Don’t make users feel like they are paying with real money</h1><blockquote>
<p>People find it harder to spend money when they’re paying in cash than if they’re using a card.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Require users to pay with a credit card, and force the card to be saved. This makes the user easier to spend money for subsequent impulse buys.<br>Apparently, tourist attractions also do this, because they hold foreign currency with an unfamiliar value.</p>

<p>If incense costs 80 pokecoins and a batch of 550 pokecoins costs $4.99, how much real money does incense cost? Yeah i don’t know either.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It is hard to determine the amount of money spent <em>and</em> the amount of virtual currency being spent, making micropayments seem virtual to stupid users.<br>Paying with virtual currency also has the advantage of bypassing the credit card.</p>

<p>It’s clever how you can only buy Lunchboxes so you don’t know what you’ll get out of them</p>

<p>Some in-game items are purely gambling. Users will convince themselves than spending 880 Nexon cash (or whatever it’s called) is a good idea for buying a <a href="https://maplewiki.net/index.php?title=Gachapon" target="_blank" rel="external">“Gachapon”</a>, a lottery service that may or may not yield an in-game item more valuable than 880 currency units.</p>

Pay to lure more pokemon, pay to save progress at any time, pay to get a slightly better weapon. The game can still be played without payments, but it seems to users that they can simply pay to wipe the pain away.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>They have the incentives to insert pain points into the game.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>If it seems like you’re about to quit, hey here’s a discount. Or if you’re the type of person who will spend a lot of money, maybe they bump up the prices a bit.</p>

    	<p>As a mobile developer (if I can be called as such), I download competitor apps for business intelligence. This weekend, I downloaded <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.sdu.didi.psnger" target="_blank" rel="external">Didi Kuaidi</a>, whose <a href="http://fortune.com/2016/05/06/didi-kuaidi-funding/" target="_blank" rel="external">company</a> has exceeded Uber China’s market cap threefold ($25B vs $8B).</p>
<p>With this sort of market cap, they must have hired hundreds of thousands of smart Chinese developers to make a killer Android app, right? As it turns out, any question I ask here can be answered with ‘no.’</p>
<p>First thing after opening the app–which required more than a page of permissions to install–you are greeted with “Do you want to update?”</p>
<p><img src="/image/Screenshot_20160507-085649.png" alt="But I just downloaded the app!"></p>
<p>A stroke of genius from them: since Google Play Services is not that common in China, people there turn on “allow installations from unknown sources”, which allows/forces apps to update themselves like this.</p>
<p><img src="/image/Screenshot_20160507-085428.png" alt="Chinese apps download their own APKs"></p>
<p>After you update, you get this glorious map of sooty Beijing:</p>
<p><img src="/image/Screenshot_20160507-090027.png" alt="Sooty Beijing"><br><img src="/image/Screenshot_20160507-090204.png" alt="Not so sooty"></p>
<p>Why the map centers at Beijing, it is simple: the company is headquartered there. Why, then, can a startup 1/1000 of that size not have to have its app simply center its map in Toronto by default, is mind-boggling.<br>The app also does not try to obtain the user’s location, which is presumably where most trips would start.</p>
<p>I have received many, <em>many</em> complaints about the map (in my app, whichever one you think it is) being slow, and we just <em>need</em> to fix, optimise, and make it pretty. Well, look at this $25B map:</p>
<p><img src="/image/Screenshot_20160507-090213.png" alt="Slow map"></p>
<p>The map is some sort of custom Google Maps (or a very close imitation of it), which highlights the regions in which Didi Kuaidi offers service. I like that. Instead of doing just that, I have decided to disappoint my users <em>after</em> they perform a search. This allows me to generate a “demand heat map” with these failed searches.</p>
<p><img src="/image/Screenshot_20160507-090237.png" alt="Service areas"></p>
<p>There are many cute intro screens when you try to access the “UberPool of China”. I like those too.</p>
<p><img src="/image/Screenshot_20160507-090248.png" alt="Intro"><br><img src="/image/Screenshot_20160507-090258.png" alt="Intro"></p>
<p>Just when you think you are about done looking through this app, and would like to check the ‘Activity Centre’ to see what’s new. And lo, in all its glory:</p>
<p><img src="/image/Screenshot_20160507-090459.png" alt="What the shit is this"></p>
<p>It is then when I finally realised:<br><strong>Nobody cares about your stupid app. <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=site%3Areddit.com+finally+material+design" target="_blank" rel="external">Nobody cares if it is polished.</a> All it needs to do is work.</strong></p>

    	<p>Ever had your friend proofread your thesis, and all you got for comments are things like “missing Oxford comma here” or “I think this word should be underlined”? As it turns out, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parkinson%27s_law_of_triviality" target="_blank" rel="external">there is a term for that: bikeshedding</a>!</p>
<p>Bikeshedding describes the amount of time people spend on trivial things versus the non-trivial. Naturally, one <em>ought to</em> spend more time on the non-trivial because they are more difficult to understand; however, because so many people know about the trivial, they argue, over and over, about them. About the unimportant.</p>
<p>Wikipedia has <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Avoid_Parkinson%27s_Bicycle_Shed_Effect" target="_blank" rel="external">its own meta article about its articles</a> warning its editors against arguing about the trivial.</p>
<p>Bikeshed.com, a domain dedicated to this phenomenon, contains a sweet quote:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“The really, really short answer is that you should not. The somewhat longer answer is that just because you are capable of building a bikeshed does not mean you should stop others from building one just because you do not like the color they plan to paint it. This is a metaphor indicating that you need not argue about every little feature just because you know enough to do so. Some people have commented that the amount of noise generated by a change is inversely proportional to the complexity of the change.” - <a href="http://bikeshed.com/" target="_blank" rel="external">bikeshed.com</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p><a href="http://meta.stackexchange.com/questions/31253/the-bikeshed-problem-and-stack-exchange" target="_blank" rel="external">Some people</a> argue that the trivial is not what the argument is about; many people believe that the argument is actually about game theory between the relative knowledge of the writer and the reader, while others think the ratio between trivial and non-trivial should strike a perfect balance to get the most out of a review.</p>
<p>To this day, I am still unsure how to tackle this problem at my workplace.</p>

    	<p>Startups (start-ups) are hard.</p>
<p>You are the CEO of <em>QuickHolland</em>, a company that sells instant hollandaise sauce (currently in R&amp;D) in revolutionary, squeeze-bottle form factor.</p>
<p>As a founder in a startup, you likely have several priorities to juggle:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Maintaining your vision</strong>, because it is <em>your</em> company</li>
<li><strong>Maintaining investor relations</strong>, to get advice from them (if they are on the board) or to have a constant source of funding</li>
<li><strong>Managing your day-to-day business</strong>, because, again, this company is yours to run.</li>
</ol>
<p>This post explains why it is often difficult to do all of these things.</p>
<h2 id="1-Maintaining-your-vision"><a href="#1-Maintaining-your-vision" class="headerlink" title="1. Maintaining your vision"></a>1. Maintaining your vision</h2><p>Your mother just spent an hour <a href="http://ciaoegrazie.wordpress.com/tag/gordon-ramsays-hollandaise-sauce/" target="_blank" rel="external">making hollandaise sauce from scratch</a>, and she complains to you that it was too time-consuming a thing to do in the morning–when people need to get to work on time.</p>
<p>You have an idea; a lightbulb glowed atop your head. Instant hollandaise sauce. You narrow your vision. You set your goal. You incorporate your company. And you hire on the best people you know.</p>
<p>Now what?</p>
<p><strong>Is it your job to stick to the vision, or is it sometimes appropriate to modify the company’s vision?</strong></p>
<p>One year into your saucy enterprise, you find yourself in a sticky situation, where your food scientists come up with something in a squeeze bottle, but no one is buying it. “But build it and they will come,” you think to yourself, “maybe I am not reaching the correct market.”</p>
<p>You pitch your idea to your investors and they say that your idea reeks of unoriginality. They say that it has been done before. “Is this like other hollandaise sauces out there, except <del>on social networks</del>in a squeeze bottle?” You tell them yes, but, see, the squeeze bottle is what we’re <em>really</em> selling. Your investors, agreeing with your explanation, throw money at you for another year of runway.</p>
<p><strong>Are you now selling hollandaise sauce, or are you now selling squeeze bottles?</strong></p>
<p>You go back to your team of scientists and tell them you have decided to <em>pivot</em>. To pivot is to change the direction of the company–your corporate vision has now changed. Half of your team leaves your company because they are food scientists, not petroleum engineers (who would be the people who commonly make squeeze bottles). “No matter,” you think to yourself, “I have <em>leads</em>.”</p>
<h2 id="2-Maintaining-investor-relations"><a href="#2-Maintaining-investor-relations" class="headerlink" title="2. Maintaining investor relations"></a>2. Maintaining investor relations</h2><p>You own 100% of the company, but you need some initial funding, so the first course of action, of course, is to ask family and friends for your “bootstrap” money. That money buys you time, the ability to pay lawyers and governments for business-related fees, and money to hire your first employee.</p>
<p>Of course, you will almost certainly want to hire more than one employee, so you sell your company’s <em>shares</em>, to your investors (wherever you got hold of them to begin with), for instant funding, paid back by them as <em>convertible notes</em>. With that capital, you hire your second, third, fourth employees, and so on. You know how long your <em>runway</em> is (how much money you have {div} how much money you spend per month), and so do your investors, because they request that kind of information. They give you funding because they know you have a team who can execute your idea. They give you funding because you seem like a competent leader. They give you funding because, ultimately, your company might succeed, which means more money for them.</p>
<p><strong>What if you don’t succeed?</strong></p>
<h2 id="3-Managing-your-day-to-day-business"><a href="#3-Managing-your-day-to-day-business" class="headerlink" title="3. Managing your day-to-day business"></a>3. Managing your day-to-day business</h2><p><em>QuickHolland</em> is your first business, and it is your baby. By now, you have been working on it for three years, and you have pivoted three times so far; your company now prints posters for supermarkets that sell your brilliant squeeze bottles, turning your company into an advertising agency. You still have your brilliant team of people, but only one food scientist is left at this point, because the company isn’t really making food anymore.</p>
<p>On your fourth year, you run out of funding (which is a surprising amount of time, because investors gave you only one year’s worth of money.) You cannot pay your employees for the time being, but, no matter, this too shall pass. You try very hard to look for new investors. You get about half a year worth of runway, yet again, saving the company once more.</p>
<p><strong>Are you going to pay your employees their unsettled wages? If so, how?</strong></p>
<p>Once, while swimming in Salt Lake, you encounter a young, attractive woman, who happens to be interested in you. You two share the same interests, same backgrounds, and quickly fall in love. Once she moves in, You quickly realise that you no longer have the time and patience to run and maintain the company that was once your baby and vision. Hell, it isn’t even what your mother asked for anymore.</p>
<p><strong>What comes first? Your life, or your company?</strong></p>
