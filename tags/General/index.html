    	<p><a href="https://xkcd.com/320/" target="_blank" rel="external">One of the first xkcd comics</a> (#320) describes a 28-hour day, where six of such days sum up to 168 hours, which is also what seven 24-hour days add up to. The person would then stay up for 20 hours, sleep eight hours after that, and repeat the process. Of course, ignoring the daylight factor (which, if you have a daylight-dependent sleeping schedule, you would not be reading this in the first place), a person still needs to work, play, planning such a six-day week around the world that revolves around them. What does that look like?</p>
<p><img src="/image/7-day.png" alt=""></p>
<p>If your workplace allows somewhat flexible hours, or if they only specify core hours, then by shifting your Tuesday schedule a bit late, and your Friday schedule a bit early, then you are only 10% deviated from the rest of the world, in a typical 40-hour work week. If the place of employment really wants you to put 40 hours during <em>their</em> workdays, just shift that excel spreadsheet left by four days. Now, you start work two hours early on their Monday, and start two hours late on their Friday. In such a plan, like normal human beings, you will not be working during normal weekends.</p>
<h2 id="What-does-it-look-like-to-you"><a href="#What-does-it-look-like-to-you" class="headerlink" title="What does it look like to you?"></a>What does it look like to you?</h2><p><img src="/image/6-day.png" alt=""></p>
<p>At first, if you commit to centering your life around your sleep, then you get eight hours of sleep at “midnight” every day. The time at which you leave for work will be drastically different every “day”. On day 1 (whatever name you give it), you will work at 10am. On day 4, you will start working at 8pm, finishing at “28pm”, your midnight.</p>
<h2 id="Bonus-exercise-when-do-shops-open"><a href="#Bonus-exercise-when-do-shops-open" class="headerlink" title="Bonus exercise: when do shops open?"></a>Bonus exercise: <em>when do shops open?</em></h2><p>Enough about work. Your life is a lot more than just work. How about food? How about entertainment? When are things open relative to your 6-day week? Well, highlighting the 9am~7pm range, when shops are typically open and available to you?</p>
<p><img src="/image/6-day-ds.png" alt=""></p>
<p>Well, as it turns out, there are not that many hours that you have to shop when both you and other human beings are awake. On most days, you can get away with shopping after work; it might be a bit strange for your “weekend” day, for there are three shopping hours immediately after you wake up, and three more right before you go to bed. No more eight-hour activities for you!</p>

    	<p>Once I was seven years old, my father told me,<br>“Think before you do” (or I will beat you)<br>Once I was seven years old</p>
<p>It was a big big world, but we (friends) thought we were bigger<br>Pushing each other to the limits, we were learning quicker<br>By eleven memorising poems and playing football<br>Never rich so we were out to make that steady figure</p>
<p>Once I was eleven years old, my father told me,<br>“Go read yourself a [rich dad poor dad book] (or you’ll die poorly).”<br>Once I was eleven years old</p>
<p>I always had that dream, like my father before me<br>So I started picking stocks, I started getting degrees<br>Something about that glory just always seemed to bore me<br>‘Cause only those I really love will ever really know me</p>
<p>Once I was twenty years old, my story got told<br>Before the morning sun, when life was lonely<br>Once I was twenty years old</p>
<p>“Don’t be trapped with a girl before you establish your career”<br>“Smart guy controls his pennis (<em>sic</em>) with his brian (<em>sic</em>) rather the vice versa”<br>I got my boys with me, at least those in favor<br>And if we don’t meet before I leave, I hope I’ll see you later</p>
<p>Once I was twenty years old, my story got told<br>I was forgetting about everything I saw before me<br>Once I was twenty years old</p>
<p>Soon we’ll be thirty years old, our properties have been sold<br>We’ve traveled around the world and we’re still roaming<br>Soon we’ll be thirty years old</p>
<p>I’m still learning about life<br>My woman is still imaginary<br>So I can sing myself some songs<br>And I can make up stories<br>None of my boys are with me<br>They are all out seeking glory<br>And some I had to keep around<br>My brother, I’m so sorry</p>
<p>Soon I’ll be sixty years old, my father gets however old<br>Remember life, and then your life becomes a better one<br>I made a man so happy when I wrote an email once<br>I hope just someone come and visit once or twice a month</p>
<p>Soon I’ll be sixty years old, will I think the world is cold<br>Or will I have a lot of children who can warm me?<br>Soon I’ll be sixty years old</p>
<p>Soon I’ll be sixty years old, will I think the world is cold<br>Or will I have a lot of children who can warm me?<br>Soon I’ll be sixty years old</p>
