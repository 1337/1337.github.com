    	<p><strong>tl;dr</strong>: Buy sherry.</p>
<p>Sure, sure, LCBO rips you off. Sure, sure, dangers of alcohol consumption. But, for the poor and desperate, the quest for the cheapest booze must continue. But what if you are already drunk, and cannot do the maths? This is the post for you.</p>
<h2 id="Sourcing"><a href="#Sourcing" class="headerlink" title="Sourcing"></a>Sourcing</h2><p>Back in 2013, it was possible to search for <code>*</code> on lcbo.com, and have it throw up an entire database worth of data. Data mining was easy. All you needed was a web browser and some script. Such a scraping effort was recorded <a href="https://gist.github.com/1337/6190299/cd04e29988a4ca78f4e682e7f38dece56e310e23" target="_blank" rel="external">in the form of a JSON file</a>.</p>
<p>It was good while it lasted. Today, you can no longer search for <code>*</code> and get something reasonable. You will need <a href="https://lcboapi.com/" target="_blank" rel="external">an API</a> for that.<br>Thankfully, the unofficial LCBO API, for whatever reason, allows me to paginate through their entire database. Here is my sloppy code:</p>

    	<p>Smartphones are getting more and more powerful, and people are spending more time looking at their phones as ever. So, how much should they be?</p>
<p>Joe, the average consumer, uses his phablet exclusively. He no longer prints documents, types, or uses his desktop for anything. He believes that the price of “a Samsung”, $700, is justified by the fact that it does everything he needs (emails, WhatsApp, Candy Crush).</p>
<p>Joe (the other one), on the other hand, was an English major. Nowadays, he mostly browses Tumblr in the subway on his way to work, flirts with boys for whom he makes coffee, and watches Netflix on his phone when he gets home. He has an iPhone 6s.</p>
<p>Joe (yet another one), his customer, uses his iPhone 6s Plus almost exclusively for Instagramming his lattes. He paid some $1000 for his iPhone on contract, and he loves it.</p>
<p>So, how much is too much for a phone?<br>The simple answer is, it doesn’t matter. You are reading a blog post that clearly has no purpose.</p>

<li>Those who believe in telekinetics, raise my hand</li>
<li>Well, if I called the wrong number, why did you answer the phone?</li>
<li>None but a coward dares to boast that he has never known fear.</li>
<li>If you can do a half-assed job of anything, you’re a one-eyed man in a kingdom of the blind.</li>
<li>Laughter and tears are both responses to frustration and exhaustion. I myself prefer to laugh, since there is less cleaning up to do afterward.</li>
<li>How nice–to feel nothing, and still get full credit for being alive.</li>
<li>Like so many Americans, she was trying to construct a life that made sense from things she found in gift shops.</li>
<li>I hate women because they always know where things are.</li>
<li>It is better to know some of the questions than all of the answers.</li>
<li>If you live to be one hundred, you’ve got it made. Very few people die past that age.</li>
<li>President: If one morning I walked on top of the water across the Potomac River, the headline that afternoon would read “President Can’t Swim”.</li>
