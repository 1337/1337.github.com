<h1 id="How-not-to-procrastinate"><a href="#How-not-to-procrastinate" class="headerlink" title="How not to procrastinate"></a>How not to procrastinate</h1><p>Learning a new thing or doing something you would rather not do can be stressing. This can cause anxiety at first. This activates the area associated with pain in the brain.</p>
<p>Your brain looks for a way to stop that negative feeling by switching your attention to something else more pleasant.</p>
<p><strong>The solution is to just start.</strong> Researchers discovered that not long after people start actually working out what they didn’t like, that neuro-discomfort disappeared. Remember that the better you get at something, the more enjoyable it can become.</p>
<p>Sleep is very important. Exercising produces new neurons, so it is also very important.</p>
<h1 id="Learning-effectively"><a href="#Learning-effectively" class="headerlink" title="Learning effectively"></a>Learning effectively</h1><p>Learn through association, and many concepts will become one, occupying “one memory”. This allows you to learn more.</p>
<p>Turn off distractions, solve problems, and recall without looking at the material. <strong>Repetition is key.</strong> Test yourself as necessary.</p>
<p>Use a familiar place (like the blueprint of your house) and associate visual images of things you want to remember with physical places.</p>

    	<p><strong>tl;dr</strong> No wonder the book is free.</p>
<p>O’Reilly <a href="http://www.oreilly.com/programming/free/files/how-to-make-mistakes-in-python.pdf" target="_blank" rel="external">offered us this free eBook</a> titled “How to make Mistakes in Python.” I am not sure if it was very good. Here are the key points.</p>
<h1 id="Setup"><a href="#Setup" class="headerlink" title="Setup"></a>Setup</h1><ul>
<li>Not using pip</li>
<li>Using the default REPL (Author recommended Jupyter but iPython is obviously superior)</li>

<h1 id="Silly-things"><a href="#Silly-things" class="headerlink" title="Silly things"></a>Silly things</h1><ul>
<li>Not returning a value</li>
<li>Typos</li>
<li>Using <code>def</code> when you should have used <code>class</code> (which is 100% valid syntax)</li>
</ul>
<h1 id="Style"><a href="#Style" class="headerlink" title="Style"></a>Style</h1><ul>
<li>Using <code>notationTheHungarian</code></li>
<li>Violating pep8</li>
<li>Stupid names like <code>x</code> and <code>c</code> or <code>class TestImagineAClassNameThatExceeds80Characters</code></li>
<li>Complicated lambdas</li>
<li>Long ass-comprehensions</li>
</ul>
<h1 id="Structure"><a href="#Structure" class="headerlink" title="Structure"></a>Structure</h1><ul>
<li>“Pathological if/elif blocks”, ie. Complicated flow control (cyclomatic complexity)</li>
<li>Useless getters and setters</li>
<li>Loads of decorators</li>
<li>Breaking the Law of Demeter, ie. Accessing attributes of arguments</li>
<li>Too many “__private” attributes</li>
<li>God objects and God methods</li>
<li>Things with global state</li>
</ul>
<h1 id="Surprises"><a href="#Surprises" class="headerlink" title="Surprises"></a>Surprises</h1><ul>
<li>Importing everything</li>
<li>Catching everything</li>
<li>Reinventing the standard library</li>
<li>Mutable argument defaults</li>
<li>Not using generators and wasting memory</li>
<li>Expecting <code>tearDown</code> is run in tests</li>
<li>Not logging</li>
<li>Not testing</li>
</ul>
<p>These are really, really obvious mistakes that the apprentice developer would make, perhaps exclusively before they get a job, or before they finish high school. I hope they never happen to you.</p>

    	<p>On Facebook, you can occasionally see blank avatars that look like a man with short hair, or avatars that look like <a href="https://www.facebook.com/pages/Default-female-FB-avatar-sorta-looks-like-Darth-Vader/192167327472723" target="_blank" rel="external">Darth Vader</a>.</p>
<p>As it turns out, the latter is Facebook’s idea of an anonymous female person. And that is, insofar as <a href="http://www.apa.org/pi/lgbt/resources/sexuality-definitions.pdf" target="_blank" rel="external">gender identity</a> is concerned, politically incorrect.</p>
<p>Just earlier today, I was schooled by a colleague of mine about my political incorrectness:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Gender is a spectrum, and many people don’t identify simply as “him” or “her”.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I thought they (my colleague, as a singular person/being, who appears to be male, but did not specifically identify in particular) had the right idea there, and I agree, perhaps catering for just 90% of anything is being ignorant. Being a start-up (startup?), why not go the extra mile to cater to those we care about?</p>
<p>While calling someone (or some <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Otherkin" target="_blank" rel="external">otherkin</a>?) <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ignorance" target="_blank" rel="external">ignorant</a> would be a serious accusation, the general idea would still stand. <a href="http://www.goodreads.com/quotes/tag/willful-ignorance" target="_blank" rel="external">The sole fact of you rejecting the notion that you are ignorant is being ignorant</a>, unless you also accept that (presumably facts) which are delivered to you, in which case, you are not ignorant, because you have taken in information from others.</p>
<p>A major problem with this mode of thinking is that <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Argument_from_ignorance#Basic_argument" target="_blank" rel="external">it is impossible to disprove your ignorance without being viewed as ignorant in the first place</a>. Then again, who cares, right? It’s not like anyone <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/tumblrinaction" target="_blank" rel="external">rejects to the thought of being open-minded</a>. You open your mind to everything others tell you, you become one of them, everybody wins.</p>
<h2 id="Never-refer-to-someone-as-“male”-or-“female”"><a href="#Never-refer-to-someone-as-“male”-or-“female”" class="headerlink" title="Never refer to someone as “male” or “female”"></a>Never refer to someone as “male” or “female”</h2><p>When you see someone (or some <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Otherkin" target="_blank" rel="external">otherkin</a>) on the streets, it is politically incorrect to assume that such as being is male or female. In fact, <a href="http://www.ndsu.edu/lgbtq/faq/" target="_blank" rel="external">many people and beings</a> refer to themselves as at least eight other types of identities:</p>
<ul>
<li>L: Lesbian</li>
<li>G: Gay</li>
<li>B: Bisexual</li>
<li>T: Transgender or Transsexual</li>
<li>Q: Queer or Questioning</li>
<li>I: Intersex (previously referred to as “hermaphrodite”, but Intersex is the more acceptable term to use now)</li>
<li>A: Asexual or Ally</li>
<li>2-S: Two Spirit (drawn from Native culture to refer to people who walk in two worlds – female and male)</li>
<li>(and many more; see <a href="http://www.ndsu.edu/lgbtq/faq/" target="_blank" rel="external">source</a>)</li>
</ul>
<p>While I am admittedly ignorant in that I have heard of, but never bothered, to learn about the “Ally” gender, or the difference between being two-spirit and intersex, I have learned today that I should at least never refer to anyone as just male or female, or either male or female, for that matter.</p>
<p>Much like you cannot call an African American person with that word they call each other, if someone self-identifies as male, that is <em>not</em> grounds for you (even if you identify as a male) to refer to such a person/being as “him”. This is your ignorance spewing out of your old-fashioned brain.</p>
<h2 id="Assume-all-terms-will-offend-unless-otherwise-given-permission"><a href="#Assume-all-terms-will-offend-unless-otherwise-given-permission" class="headerlink" title="Assume all terms will offend unless otherwise given permission"></a>Assume all terms will offend unless otherwise given permission</h2><p>Many people/beings care about what you don’t care about, and that does not make what they care about any less important than what you care about.</p>
<p>Just because, say, you self-identify as either male or female, and 90% of your friends and family self-identify as either male or female, it does not change the fact that there are many people/beings out there (10% of 6 billion [humans] is 600 million, right?) who self-identify as neither of these, regardless of their sex by birth. See: <a href="http://www.apa.org/pi/lgbt/resources/sexuality-definitions.pdf" target="_blank" rel="external">Sex, Gender, Gender Identity and Sexual Orientation</a>.</p>
<p>Such words and/or phrases you use to describe a person/being may offend them. These are called <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trauma_trigger" target="_blank" rel="external">triggers</a>; they put people/beings into a state of trauma.</p>
<p>As a result, if a person/being self-identifies to you as female, for example, it <em>should not</em> mean anything to you in understanding them (that person/being, a singular). The person/being self-identifies as female. That only gives that person/being the right to call themselves a female; it does not give you the right to call themselves a female.</p>
<p>Only when a person/being says,</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Please identify me as (one of the choices above), (your name),</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Should you be allowed to identify them as the choice specified.</p>
<h2 id="Never-be-offended"><a href="#Never-be-offended" class="headerlink" title="Never be offended"></a>Never be offended</h2><p>You need to play your part in this, of course! When someone says anything that upsets you, do not take it seriously. Instead, treat the offender with respect.</p>
<p>For example, if someone says you are disgusting and tells you to go fuc* yourself, don’t dwell on the fact that someone called you disgusting; focus on how you can improve yourself instead.</p>
<h2 id="Accommodate-the-minority-for-what-they-identify-to-be"><a href="#Accommodate-the-minority-for-what-they-identify-to-be" class="headerlink" title="Accommodate the minority for what they identify to be"></a>Accommodate the minority for what they identify to be</h2><p>No rule in (your country) sets forth the number of genders from which one may choose to identify; you can identify as any gender you want, including genders apart from the “popular” ones listed above.</p>
<p>Bear in mind that other people/beings can identify under a unique gender, as well.</p>
<p>Imagine a <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0149460/" target="_blank" rel="external">Futurama</a>-like world where a person/being you see on the streets can be a human, an alien, or a sewage dweller. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Mutants_Are_Revolting" target="_blank" rel="external">People/beings in that world respect each other</a>, communicate with each other as if they are the same kind. This is the world we are currently gearing towards, except there is no visual difference between each identifiable gender, unlike each species found in Futurama.</p>
<p>When a person/being claims to be a gay, please treat them like a normal person/being. Do note, “normal” changes quite a lot, so please keep up with the society for the correct way to deal with each situation.</p>
<h2 id="Have-fun"><a href="#Have-fun" class="headerlink" title="Have fun"></a>Have fun</h2><p>Gays, queers, bisexuals… they all enjoy the world like you do, and all deserve to live a life they ought them to be. If you are gender identity-agnostic, everyone/every being you meet are just like each other. So, have fun! Enjoy the world around you. There are a lot of genders to explore.</p>

    	<p>Let me tell you a story about <strong>Medicals</strong>, my personal project from 2004.</p>
<h2 id="Prequel"><a href="#Prequel" class="headerlink" title="Prequel"></a>Prequel</h2><p>I did an educational manoeuvre at around the age of 14. I was an innocent person at the time – so young, so ambitious, yet so full of nothing. My life took a strange turn one day, when the school where I studied decided to give us all a project in Microsoft Access:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Make a form that shows contents of a table. (or something… it was more than a decade ago)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Intuitively, all that a student had to do was to fire up MS Access, create a new database with a form in it, where fields in the form are linked to columns in that table. That would get you 100%. However, being the person that I was, I made such a thing:</p>
<p><img src="/image/sneak_peak_3.jpg" alt="not Medicals"></p>
<p>(The ‘table’ beneath the UI handled expense records, hence the name “Expense”.)</p>
<p>From the screenshot, it was apparent that I made at least 5 iterations of the Expense project.</p>
<p><a href="https://google.com/search?q=David+Kirby" title="I know, I know... it&#39;s a very common name. I can&#39;t find him online, either." target="_blank" rel="external">David Kirby</a>, my ICT (IT) teacher at the time, told me I did a good job.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>I did a good job.</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p>At the age of (a young age), my naivete thought that MS Access was the go-to platform for creating computer interfaces, for realising dreams like others do; ranging from classic address books to entire operating systems, I attempted recreating them all.</p>
<p>FA, Windows 98 in Access!<br><img src="/image/simulator98.png" alt="FA, Windows 98 in Access!"></p>
<p>FA, Windows in Access run on Windows that looks like Mac OS X!<br><img src="/image/simulatormac1.png" alt="FA, Windows in Access run on Windows that looks like Mac OS X!"></p>
<p>FA, Windows XP in Access – it’s even widescreen!<br><img src="/image/simulator23.png" alt="FA, Windows XP in Access -- it&#39;s even widescreen!"></p>
<p>These were all created at the peak of my ignorance. At that age, when the Internet was nothing more than Yahoo! mail, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MSN_Explorer" target="_blank" rel="external">MSN Explorer</a>, and <a href="http://stickdeathreborn.tk" target="_blank" rel="external">stickdeath.com</a>, ignorance is not only bliss–it was my only choice. To make sure you understand how stupid these projects were, everything in the form was an image resource. Each resource points to an image file, which then in turn can be placed on the form. They have pre-written handlers that simply make other elements show and hide.</p>
<p>Then came Medicals.</p>
<h2 id="Medicals-the-early-days"><a href="#Medicals-the-early-days" class="headerlink" title="Medicals: the early days"></a>Medicals: the early days</h2><p>At the height of passionate “software” development, I came up with this ambitious idea while visiting my family doctor, who went by the name of <em>Ng</em>. He was an incompetent wad who happened to be the doctor closest to where my family resided. He had cabinets upon cabinets of patient records that were retrieved by hand. I thought: what if I made something for this guy, who clearly has a need for a computerised system?</p>
<p><img src="/image/medicals.png" alt="Medicals 1.1"></p>
<p><img src="/image/medi13c.png" alt="Medicals 1.3"></p>
<p>Having gained the experience to do stupid things very quickly, Medicals 1.0 (not pictured) was born. The first version, like its predecessors, are merely MS Access forms that link to table entries. However, Medicals 1.3 was a little different. Forms were linked to <em>queries</em> instead, and there was a reporting option, which were <em>reports</em> linked to queries. This allowed the interface to show both information about a particular patient, and a list of medications that was given to the patient (in the image above, the patient was repeatedly given arbitrary doses of Vitamin C).</p>
<p><img src="/image/medi15c2.png" alt="Medicals 1.5"></p>
<p>Medicals 1.5 was “released” in the sense that <code>medicals.mdb</code> was copied elsewhere as <code>medicals15.mdb</code>. From the only surviving screenshot, it can be seen that doctor <em>Ng</em> can now record the number of days for which he prescribed water to the patient.</p>
<h2 id="Medicals-2-where-the-crazy-got-crazier"><a href="#Medicals-2-where-the-crazy-got-crazier" class="headerlink" title="Medicals 2: where the crazy got crazier"></a>Medicals 2: where the crazy got crazier</h2><p>Even a crazy person would, at this point, realise that <em>real</em> people, like a doctor, would not use something, let alone a mission-critical database, from a (young person). However, I was not crazy. I was deranged. I was an energetic, deranged man, who would take this project to the end of its days, until someone, somewhere, actually uses my work for real.</p>
<p>The Medicals 2 series was made “available to the public” some time in 2005.</p>
<p><img src="/image/medicalsv216c.png" alt="Medicals 2.16c"></p>
<p>Version 2 underwent a significant visual overhaul (read: turned buttons into images), a change of identity (that bogus company from previous screenshots had been swapped with yet another bogus one), as well as a few <code>for</code> loops, evident in the “Automate/Batch” section. I have no clue what it did anymore.</p>
<p>One key innovation I thought I implemented at the time was the concept of <em>loading</em>. Many software programs at the time – particularly Microsoft products – had loading screens, which was shown while the software did <em>something</em> behind the scenes.</p>
<p>I also made a loading screen for Medicals. Not before the database was slow, but because I wanted a loading screen. As a result, the loading screen was simply opened and closed according to a timer.</p>

<p>Medicals 2.49 was the last version with a preserved screenshot, and the final version number for the project went as high as 2.65. I discovered something called <em>Visual Basic</em>, which, behold, created real software executables. That, along with whatever reason that prevented databases created by non-English versions of MS Access to be opened elsewhere, ended my plan to ever re-open the archive of mystery that is <code>Medical265.mdb</code>.</p>
