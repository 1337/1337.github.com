    	<p>I believe everyone should learn something every day. Here is what I learned every so often.</p>
<h1 id="Working-with-yourself"><a href="#Working-with-yourself" class="headerlink" title="Working with yourself"></a>Working with yourself</h1><h2 id="Keep-a-journal"><a href="#Keep-a-journal" class="headerlink" title="Keep a journal"></a>Keep a journal</h2><p>Chances are, you won’t remember everything.<br>Keep a journal. For work. For home. For your personal life (sometimes known as a diary).<br>Write down what you did that day, and what you learned that day.<br>Not only does that help you remember everything, it helps you hold yourself accountable, too.</p>
<h2 id="Remember-what-people-said"><a href="#Remember-what-people-said" class="headerlink" title="Remember what people said"></a>Remember what people said</h2><p>People tell you things all the time. Then they expect you to remember everything.<br>Chances are, you won’t remember everything.<br>What down what people say. Later, you can find out why something was done this way or not this way, and hold them accountable, too.</p>
<h2 id="Know-what-people-do-in-the-company"><a href="#Know-what-people-do-in-the-company" class="headerlink" title="Know what people do in the company"></a>Know what people do in the company</h2><p>It will eventually come to you that not everyone in your company is a developer, and they all do different things. They all <em>want</em> different things out of their jobs, and they have different objectives to what they do.<br>You should observe what they do, know the things they pay close attention to, and learn from them.</p>
<h2 id="Memorise-the-org-chart"><a href="#Memorise-the-org-chart" class="headerlink" title="Memorise the org chart"></a>Memorise the org chart</h2><p>It is rarely wise to let others tell you what to do, when they aren’t in your department.<br>This is less important in a startup, of course, but remember, no one budgeted your sprint time for other departments’ activities.<br>Likewise (37), if someone higher up messages you directly, there is no hard requirement for you to respond directly, either (though you should).</p>
<h2 id="There’s-no-point-if-you-aren’t-the-best"><a href="#There’s-no-point-if-you-aren’t-the-best" class="headerlink" title="There’s no point if you aren’t the best"></a>There’s no point if you aren’t the best</h2><p>No one hired you to be mediocre. Therefore, only only must you be the best, you must be <em>your</em> best.</p>
<h2 id="Log-your-sick-and-vacation-days"><a href="#Log-your-sick-and-vacation-days" class="headerlink" title="Log your sick (and vacation) days"></a>Log your sick (and vacation) days</h2><p>Everyone should be keeping track of themselves.<br>Eliminate the means of your company screwing you over on paid days off.</p>
<h2 id="Make-friends"><a href="#Make-friends" class="headerlink" title="Make friends"></a>Make friends</h2><p>On a personal level, you will want to build relationships with the people who work with you.<br>A happy colleague is a happy you.</p>
<h2 id="If-it-isn’t-difficult-it-isn’t-worth-doing"><a href="#If-it-isn’t-difficult-it-isn’t-worth-doing" class="headerlink" title="If it isn’t difficult, it isn’t worth doing"></a>If it isn’t difficult, it isn’t worth doing</h2><p>You learn only by challenging yourselves. Being an accountant for a decade doesn’t make you better at making spreadsheets than one who’s fresh out of college.<br>Use your time wisely. When it comes to problem selection, choose the hard ones.</p>
<h2 id="Leave-your-comfort-zone"><a href="#Leave-your-comfort-zone" class="headerlink" title="Leave your comfort zone"></a>Leave your comfort zone</h2><p>Work on other projects. <a href="/2016/How-to-learn-how-to-learn/">Start small. The most important thing is to start, and don’t give up until you finish.</a></p>
<h2 id="Help-out"><a href="#Help-out" class="headerlink" title="Help out"></a>Help out</h2><p>When people need help, that means the problem is either hard (in which you can learn), or easy (for which you earn respect.) It’s a win-win.<br>(Or they’re trying to waste your time with mundane things. Need to watch out for that.)</p>
<h2 id="Expand-your-horizons"><a href="#Expand-your-horizons" class="headerlink" title="Expand your horizons"></a>Expand your horizons</h2><p>The world doesn’t just do what you do; go out there and learn some stuff. If you know C++, learn Java.</p>
<h2 id="Excel-in-your-territory"><a href="#Excel-in-your-territory" class="headerlink" title="Excel in your territory"></a>Excel in your territory</h2><p>“Be good at what you do” should be your baseline.<br>“Be the best at what you do” should be your benchmark.<br>“Be the best at what everyone else does” should be your life goal.</p>
<h2 id="If-you-don’t-know-something-ask"><a href="#If-you-don’t-know-something-ask" class="headerlink" title="If you don’t know something, ask"></a>If you don’t know something, ask</h2><p>Asking questions almost always means you get a better idea at something, especially outside your area of expertise.<br>Also, asking questions, much like a favour, makes people like you. This is a form of social engineering.</p>
<h2 id="Don’t-wait-until-something-becomes-a-problem"><a href="#Don’t-wait-until-something-becomes-a-problem" class="headerlink" title="Don’t wait until something becomes a problem"></a>Don’t wait until something becomes a problem</h2><p>Whatever you built inevitably has bugs (unless you did write 10000 tests for every line of code, which is not unheard of.) Some bugs are merged with the expectation that they are never considered a use case for the feature.<br>If you have time, close those holes. You don’t want someone to hack you one day.</p>
<h2 id="Don’t-let-production-users-find-your-bugs-15"><a href="#Don’t-let-production-users-find-your-bugs-15" class="headerlink" title="Don’t let production users find your bugs (15)"></a>Don’t let production users find your bugs (15)</h2><p>Knowingly pushing buggy code, knowing there is a deadline, should not be part of your work culture.<br>Once you show your users buggy code, there is no way to undo that mistake.</p>
<p><strong>Counter argument</strong>: “If a flag can get it done let’s get it done. Launching is the best way to find problems to fix” (29)</p>
<h2 id="Be-ready-to-fix-things-on-production-42"><a href="#Be-ready-to-fix-things-on-production-42" class="headerlink" title="Be ready to fix things on production (42)"></a>Be ready to fix things on production (42)</h2><p>Production services should never have errors. One advantage of being in an error-free state is the error emails that you (must set up, and) receive will be actual errors that you must fix, so you don’t simply filter them away.</p>
<h2 id="Implement-to-the-spec-17"><a href="#Implement-to-the-spec-17" class="headerlink" title="Implement to the spec (17)"></a>Implement to the spec (17)</h2><p>Once a spec is done, whatever is within the spec, you do exactly what the spec says. <em>The only parts within your control is that which is not written down.</em></p>
<h2 id="“If-you-are-given-your-own-job-would-you-take-it-”"><a href="#“If-you-are-given-your-own-job-would-you-take-it-”" class="headerlink" title="“If you are given your own job, would you take it?”"></a>“If you are given your own job, would you take it?”</h2><p>To do a good job, you must like what you do. If you are offered your own job right now, and you don’t want to take it, then you are probably both in a bad job, and doing a bad job.</p>
<h1 id="Working-with-code"><a href="#Working-with-code" class="headerlink" title="Working with code"></a>Working with code</h1><h2 id="Write-tests"><a href="#Write-tests" class="headerlink" title="Write tests"></a>Write tests</h2><p>Tests can sometimes save you back more time than the time you spend writing them.<br>Well, depends on how the code was written, anyway. More about testable code later.</p>
<h2 id="Make-small-tasks-for-yourself-2"><a href="#Make-small-tasks-for-yourself-2" class="headerlink" title="Make small tasks for yourself (2)"></a>Make small tasks for yourself (2)</h2><p>Break your tasks into smaller, understandable pieces.</p>
<p>Someone might come to you and say, “build me this.”<br>When “this” is a huge endeavour, you will be overwhelmed by the requirements and deadline planning. You don’t actually know what “this” entails.</p>
<h2 id="Make-a-feature-branch-if-the-task-is-big-47"><a href="#Make-a-feature-branch-if-the-task-is-big-47" class="headerlink" title="Make a feature branch if the task is big (47)"></a>Make a feature branch if the task is big (47)</h2><p>A task can be so large that requires collaboration among developers in near real time.<br>In that case, it is probably better to work on a branch, pushing directly to it, and submit the final product for review, rather than submitting each individual change, which the QA must test one by one.</p>
<h2 id="Tests-will-fail"><a href="#Tests-will-fail" class="headerlink" title="Tests will fail"></a>Tests will fail</h2><p>And not only will they fail, they will be hard to fix. The 1/100/10000 rule states that for every second of code you write, you will spend 100 seconds writing tests, and 10000 more wondering why they don’t all pass. </p>
<h2 id="Make-small-changes"><a href="#Make-small-changes" class="headerlink" title="Make small changes"></a>Make small changes</h2><p>No one wants to read big changes. No one wants to test big changes.<br>When you make a big change, QA will ignore you until all other changes are merged.<br>So then you’ll have to rebase.<br>And get code reviews done, all over again.<br>Make small changes.</p>
<h2 id="Other-people’s-tech-debt-are-yours…"><a href="#Other-people’s-tech-debt-are-yours…" class="headerlink" title="Other people’s tech debt are yours…"></a>Other people’s tech debt are yours…</h2><p>If my experience is anything to go by, then I can say for certain that only you will care about technical debt.<br>Overestimate your stories so you get time to recover from the chronic debt.</p>
<p>If you happen to be a project lead, the tech debt you <em>allow</em> into your code base become yours, too. Make careful decisions before you approve or disapprove a change (45).</p>
<h2 id="…And-tech-debt-can-kill-you"><a href="#…And-tech-debt-can-kill-you" class="headerlink" title="…And tech debt can kill you"></a>…And tech debt can kill you</h2><p>After a lot of technical debt, you will start to develop mental issues. You will burn out and require actual medical care.<br>Do not ignore burnout! Take care of yourself first. Work isn’t everything.</p>
<h2 id="Users-are-stupid"><a href="#Users-are-stupid" class="headerlink" title="Users are stupid"></a>Users are stupid</h2><p>And they always, always overestimate their intelligence. There is an art to implementing unassuming UX, and you have not mastered it yet.</p>
<h2 id="Write-your-own-integration-tests"><a href="#Write-your-own-integration-tests" class="headerlink" title="Write your own integration tests"></a>Write your own integration tests</h2><p>If something breaks across components, the blame will simply be placed on you. To avoid things like that, cover yourself with some more tests.<br>No one (here) has ever said no to more tests.</p>
<h2 id="Your-code-represents-you"><a href="#Your-code-represents-you" class="headerlink" title="Your code represents you"></a>Your code represents you</h2><p>Make sure you like the looks of something before you push it out to the world. If you do a crappy job of designing an interface, your users will think</p>
<p>1) your product is a joke,<br>1) your company is a joke, and<br>1) you are a joke.</p>
<p>One or more of these may concern you. “Don’t feel pressured to push something you’re not happy with.” (30)</p>
<h2 id="Every-feature-must-have-an-on-off-switch-28"><a href="#Every-feature-must-have-an-on-off-switch-28" class="headerlink" title="Every feature must have an on/off switch (28)"></a>Every feature must have an on/off switch (28)</h2><blockquote>
<p>At least don’t make things worse than they are now [on production]. - The wise man</p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="Don’t-start-a-task-until-you-know-what-you-should-be-doing-28-42"><a href="#Don’t-start-a-task-until-you-know-what-you-should-be-doing-28-42" class="headerlink" title="Don’t start [a task] until you know what you should be doing (28, 42)"></a>Don’t start [a task] until you know what you should be doing (28, 42)</h2><p>Spearheading a task, without knowing its intended function and/or outcome, will simply waste your time if you get it wrong.<br>In the face of ambiguity, refuse the temptation to guess.</p>
<h2 id="Don’t-keep-builds-broken"><a href="#Don’t-keep-builds-broken" class="headerlink" title="Don’t keep builds broken"></a>Don’t keep builds broken</h2><p>If you keep (Jenkins) builds broken, how would you know when they find new bugs?<br>Failing builds should be dealt with swiftly.</p>
<h2 id="Document-your-changes-51"><a href="#Document-your-changes-51" class="headerlink" title="Document your changes (51)"></a>Document your changes (51)</h2><p>After a week or two, people will start to forget what does what, or what changed so it no longer does what.<br>It is probably for the best to dedicate some time to document the most updated state of any system, so you won’t need to read through all the code to find out how something works.</p>
<h1 id="Working-with-teams"><a href="#Working-with-teams" class="headerlink" title="Working with teams"></a>Working with teams</h1><h2 id="Demos-are-done-to-impress-3-38"><a href="#Demos-are-done-to-impress-3-38" class="headerlink" title="Demos are done to impress (~3, 38)"></a>Demos are done to impress (~3, 38)</h2><blockquote>
<p>“Only demo that which ought to impress”.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Don’t demo useless things.<br>The whole point of the demo is to show [people] what you’ve done (…), not to see what other people have done. Demos are a proof of work or proof of progress, something you should be proud of showing at the end of a development period.</p>
<h2 id="Business-deadlines-are-your-deadlines"><a href="#Business-deadlines-are-your-deadlines" class="headerlink" title="Business deadlines are your deadlines"></a>Business deadlines are your deadlines</h2><p>Usually, you aren’t hired to “work on a project”; you are hired to provide business value. And deadlines indirectly come from the business people who need your project done, so they can <em>actually</em> provide business value.</p>
<h2 id="As-a-team-no-one-knows-what-they’re-doing-4"><a href="#As-a-team-no-one-knows-what-they’re-doing-4" class="headerlink" title="As a team, no one knows what they’re doing (~4)"></a>As a team, no one knows what they’re doing (~4)</h2><p>One day someone might say, “developers should specify acceptance criteria.”<br>Then, in a month or two, the same person can come and say “the stakeholder (read: business) should provide a definition of done.”<br>No one knows what they’re doing.</p>
<h2 id="Pipelines-are-meant-to-be-balanced"><a href="#Pipelines-are-meant-to-be-balanced" class="headerlink" title="Pipelines are meant to be balanced"></a>Pipelines are meant to be balanced</h2><p>Too many code reviews at the same time and it burdens developers.<br>Too many things in test at the same time and it burdens QA.<br>Ideally, when a swim lane reaches a threshold, members should join code review and/or testing, so the overall velocity remains high.</p>
<p>Anyone can be QA. (Even if you suck at it, you can improve, right?)</p>
<h2 id="Don’t-let-QA-find-your-problems"><a href="#Don’t-let-QA-find-your-problems" class="headerlink" title="Don’t let QA find your problems"></a>Don’t let QA find your problems</h2><p>Your code is supposed to be free of bugs the moment it is submitted for review, so that when it passes code reviews, testing will find absolutely nothing.<br>Test your own code like it belongs to your arch enemy.</p>
<h2 id="Be-ready-to-replace-your-seniors"><a href="#Be-ready-to-replace-your-seniors" class="headerlink" title="Be ready to replace your seniors"></a>Be ready to replace your seniors</h2><p>Seniors, and even bosses come and go, and you should be the one ready to fill in their shoes. This gives you, supposedly, an advantage when it comes to readiness.</p>
<h2 id="Release-regularly-36"><a href="#Release-regularly-36" class="headerlink" title="Release regularly (36)"></a>Release regularly (36)</h2><p>The more regular releases are, the more likely bugs are to be found early.<br>Continuous deployment is its own beast so we will look into that on its own.</p>
<p>If you lead a project, you must (at least tell yourself that) release your project at the end of every development period.</p>
<h2 id="Success-metrics-should-be-independent-from-each-other"><a href="#Success-metrics-should-be-independent-from-each-other" class="headerlink" title="Success metrics should be independent from each other"></a>Success metrics should be independent from each other</h2><p>If you set your own goals, make sure they don’t depend on each other. This allows you to meet these goals one by one, and ensure you actually made (e.g. 3) goals, rather than just (e.g. 1).</p>
<h2 id="Plan-the-backlog-not-the-sprint-27"><a href="#Plan-the-backlog-not-the-sprint-27" class="headerlink" title="Plan the backlog, not the sprint (27)"></a>Plan the backlog, not the sprint (27)</h2><p>Developers should be taking the first task at the top of the backlog for more work.<br>Unordered backlogs mean unhappy developers (because unhappy businessmen don’t get the right features done). (34)</p>
<blockquote>
<p>If you don’t plan the sprints, when will they stop failing? - The wise man</p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="Don’t-do-multiple-tasks-at-the-same-time-50"><a href="#Don’t-do-multiple-tasks-at-the-same-time-50" class="headerlink" title="Don’t do multiple tasks at the same time (50)"></a>Don’t do multiple tasks at the same time (50)</h2><p>Chances are that you will end up running out of time, failing to merge all of them. Work on one thing, finish it, then work on another.</p>
<h2 id="Make-suggestions-not-criticisms-29"><a href="#Make-suggestions-not-criticisms-29" class="headerlink" title="Make suggestions, not criticisms (29)"></a>Make suggestions, not criticisms (29)</h2><p>Doing code reviews can be fun, especially when you bash someone else’s head in for writing atrocious code.<br>But resist that sadistic temptation. Help the other person grow by making suggestions. Forcing yourself to architectural questions also helps with your critical thinking.</p>
<h2 id="Keep-confidential-information-confidential-35"><a href="#Keep-confidential-information-confidential-35" class="headerlink" title="Keep confidential information confidential (35)"></a>Keep confidential information confidential (35)</h2><p>Put your company in a good light. Don’t write stupid blog posts that expose confidential trade secrets.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Let’s conduce ourselves as professionally as we can.<br>Don’t feel obligated to tell your users how things work (37).</p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="Gauge-your-sprint-velocities-39"><a href="#Gauge-your-sprint-velocities-39" class="headerlink" title="Gauge your sprint velocities (39)"></a>Gauge your sprint velocities (39)</h2><p>Put too little into one sprint, and you, as a business, will fail.<br>Try to put too much into one sprint, and the sprint will certainly fail.</p>
<p>Leverage historical data to judge how fast your developers can work.</p>
<h2 id="Have-retrospectives-1"><a href="#Have-retrospectives-1" class="headerlink" title="Have retrospectives (1)"></a>Have retrospectives (1)</h2><p>Retrospectives are a way to reflect on what you have done, and to find ways to improve from then onward.<br>Retrospectives should have actionable items (40) that are SMART, and to be revisited the next time, so you can be sure you improved over time.</p>

    	<p>With the number of developers boom from 200 to 6000, Matt Ranney, the chief systems architect,, decided to give a talk about what he wish he knew from scaling up so quickly.</p>
<h1 id="Don’t-make-microservices-for-the-sake-of-making-microservices"><a href="#Don’t-make-microservices-for-the-sake-of-making-microservices" class="headerlink" title="Don’t make microservices for the sake of making microservices"></a>Don’t make microservices for the sake of making microservices</h1><p>Microservices have surprising downsides. </p>
<p>If you are building a lot of them, you start to realise that there is a risk in breaking something whenever they are changed. There is a surprising benefit to not touching a microservice if it works.</p>
<h2 id="Speed"><a href="#Speed" class="headerlink" title="Speed"></a>Speed</h2><p>RPC is always slower than PC, and microservices are all about RPC. At some point, there is a cost to the complexity of RPC as well.</p>
<p>Your function call is now asynchronous.<br>Your function call suddenly needs to understand status codes.<br>Your function call suddenly needs schema validation.</p>
<h2 id="Politics"><a href="#Politics" class="headerlink" title="Politics"></a>Politics</h2><p>If developers don’t like the design decision of something, they might just add a knob, or maybe make their own copy of the same thing that does something differently, so they can keep their biases in how something should be done. The problem: the cost of having different languages in the stack is tremendous.</p>
<p>It is hard to share code between platforms.<br>It is hard to get developer to move between teams.<br>It fragments the development culture (different “beliefs”).</p>
<h1 id="Working-with-repos"><a href="#Working-with-repos" class="headerlink" title="Working with repos"></a>Working with repos</h1><p>There are many correct answer to managing repositories, and “one repo” is not necessarily the wrong answer.<br>Uber has 8000 repositories, mainly developers’ personal ones nevertheless, but some teams also split code repositories from configuration management repositories. </p>
<h1 id="Releasing-things"><a href="#Releasing-things" class="headerlink" title="Releasing things"></a>Releasing things</h1><p>Teams now depend on the services from other teams, so if one team lags behind, so do other teams.<br>They will need to find a compromise in terms of coordinating releases.</p>
<h1 id="Performance"><a href="#Performance" class="headerlink" title="Performance"></a>Performance</h1><h2 id="You-don’t-need-to-know-how-fast-your-thing-is-as-long-as-you-know-it-is-fast-enough"><a href="#You-don’t-need-to-know-how-fast-your-thing-is-as-long-as-you-know-it-is-fast-enough" class="headerlink" title="You don’t need to know how fast your thing is, as long as you know it is fast enough"></a>You don’t need to know how fast your thing is, as long as you know it is fast enough</h2><p>Establish a benchmark performance “SLA” with the teams that use your service, e.g. “this call will definitely complete under 10 seconds”. You know you can take as long as 10 seconds, and you know you won’t need to worry about it until the performance drops below that threshold.</p>
<h2 id="Fanout"><a href="#Fanout" class="headerlink" title="Fanout"></a>Fanout</h2><p>If everyone’s services “tend to be on the slow case”, then the overall service will be slow. That is no good; it is good to establish some sort of distributed tracing, so we can understand why something is slow overall.</p>
<h2 id="Transactions"><a href="#Transactions" class="headerlink" title="Transactions"></a>Transactions</h2><p>“Distributed transactions” in microservice architecture <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/30213456/transactions-across-rest-microservices" target="_blank" rel="external">make no sense</a>. If two things need to be done transactionally, they probably should be in the same microservice.</p>
<h2 id="Dashboards"><a href="#Dashboards" class="headerlink" title="Dashboards"></a>Dashboards</h2><p>All dashboards should be automatically generated. If you don’t do that, all the teams making their own microservices will be making different dashboards that no one understands.<br>Flame graphs are great.</p>
<h1 id="Logging"><a href="#Logging" class="headerlink" title="Logging"></a>Logging</h1><p>Make logging consistent. Don’t log too mush either–logs are not free. Logging can slow down the overall service.</p>
<h1 id="Load-testing"><a href="#Load-testing" class="headerlink" title="Load testing"></a>Load testing</h1><p>You will eventually want a way to load test on production without affecting the metrics that you collect from production.<br>You will need a way to tag “test traffic”.</p>
<h1 id="“Failure-testing”"><a href="#“Failure-testing”" class="headerlink" title="“Failure testing”"></a>“Failure testing”</h1><p>(…)</p>
<h1 id="Migrations"><a href="#Migrations" class="headerlink" title="Migrations"></a>Migrations</h1><p>Migrations sort of have to work before and after they take place. Unfortunately, teams will have to account for that. Fortunately (for Uber), microservices are easier to migrate than monolithic codebases, so they have dodged a bullet there.</p>
<h1 id="Conclusion"><a href="#Conclusion" class="headerlink" title="Conclusion"></a>Conclusion</h1><p>Despite all these helpful tips, Guy concluded with a dark note: “you’ll probably have to learn it to hard way.”</p>

    </h1>

    	<p>As a mobile developer (if I can be called as such), I download competitor apps for business intelligence. This weekend, I downloaded <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.sdu.didi.psnger" target="_blank" rel="external">Didi Kuaidi</a>, whose <a href="http://fortune.com/2016/05/06/didi-kuaidi-funding/" target="_blank" rel="external">company</a> has exceeded Uber China’s market cap threefold ($25B vs $8B).</p>
<p>With this sort of market cap, they must have hired hundreds of thousands of smart Chinese developers to make a killer Android app, right? As it turns out, any question I ask here can be answered with ‘no.’</p>
<p>First thing after opening the app–which required more than a page of permissions to install–you are greeted with “Do you want to update?”</p>
<p><img src="/image/Screenshot_20160507-085649.png" alt="But I just downloaded the app!"></p>
<p>A stroke of genius from them: since Google Play Services is not that common in China, people there turn on “allow installations from unknown sources”, which allows/forces apps to update themselves like this.</p>
<p><img src="/image/Screenshot_20160507-085428.png" alt="Chinese apps download their own APKs"></p>
<p>After you update, you get this glorious map of sooty Beijing:</p>
<p><img src="/image/Screenshot_20160507-090027.png" alt="Sooty Beijing"><br><img src="/image/Screenshot_20160507-090204.png" alt="Not so sooty"></p>
<p>Why the map centers at Beijing, it is simple: the company is headquartered there. Why, then, can a startup 1/1000 of that size not have to have its app simply center its map in Toronto by default, is mind-boggling.<br>The app also does not try to obtain the user’s location, which is presumably where most trips would start.</p>
<p>I have received many, <em>many</em> complaints about the map (in my app, whichever one you think it is) being slow, and we just <em>need</em> to fix, optimise, and make it pretty. Well, look at this $25B map:</p>
<p><img src="/image/Screenshot_20160507-090213.png" alt="Slow map"></p>
<p>The map is some sort of custom Google Maps (or a very close imitation of it), which highlights the regions in which Didi Kuaidi offers service. I like that. Instead of doing just that, I have decided to disappoint my users <em>after</em> they perform a search. This allows me to generate a “demand heat map” with these failed searches.</p>
<p><img src="/image/Screenshot_20160507-090237.png" alt="Service areas"></p>
<p>There are many cute intro screens when you try to access the “UberPool of China”. I like those too.</p>
<p><img src="/image/Screenshot_20160507-090248.png" alt="Intro"><br><img src="/image/Screenshot_20160507-090258.png" alt="Intro"></p>
<p>Just when you think you are about done looking through this app, and would like to check the ‘Activity Centre’ to see what’s new. And lo, in all its glory:</p>
<p><img src="/image/Screenshot_20160507-090459.png" alt="What the shit is this"></p>
<p>It is then when I finally realised:<br><strong>Nobody cares about your stupid app. <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=site%3Areddit.com+finally+material+design" target="_blank" rel="external">Nobody cares if it is polished.</a> All it needs to do is work.</strong></p>

    	<p>Welcome to StartupCompany. In this guide, you will learn what is necessary to work with StartupCompany as a developer.</p>
<ol>
<li>You will be assigned tasks to work on. As our development is results-driven, you will not be given deadlines until the due date.</li>
<li>The business team makes decisions based on the team’s intuition. You will be notified of their intuition when the client demands something.</li>
<li>Often, deadlines may be from an earlier point in time.</li>
<li>We run our in-house Test-Driven Development (TDD). All our tests are currently passing – new team members are expected to write zero tests.</li>
<li>StartupCompany. frequently gives away free trials to customers. The conversion rate of these trials has so far been 0%. Your responsibility is to make these free trials a reality. </li>
<li>As a form of money management, the CEO will pay you with money that will eventually exist in six-month’s time. If there is no money in the bank before the sixth month, you will not be paid.</li>
<li>As an expert in the field, you will be expected to write code that works from IE7 to IE12, including development and debug builds of desktop and mobile browsers. </li>
<li>Every developer is encouraged to document their code and processes. You can find our large repository of outdated docs in our FreeProduct repository. </li>
<li>Here at StartupCompany, we strive for results. Using the Thick Loaves(TM) philosophy, you are encouraged to push code to production every 5 minutes, however stable it is, as long as it is stable. (see point 7)  </li>
<li>Employees are expected to complete tasks in under 50% of the allocated time. </li>
<li>We have many clients, and, as such, have to fulfill requirements from each client. You will be creating marvelous work of art that does all that with just one code base. </li>
<li>You, as a new member at StartupCompany, are very special. We treat you like a team. The whole team.</li>
<li>We use Dipchat as our company issue tracker. If you find a bug, please file it inside the room named ‘Developers’. The bugs that you file will not be resolved; the bugs that you address will not be acknowledged.</li>
<li>The Business team has no technical knowledge related to building and designing a product. As such, if they ask you how long something would take to implement, please work with them and reply with ‘a very short time.’</li>
<li>We are a six year-old company, and we have made a lot of great products in the past. You will be working on a relatively new project that needs to have features from all previous iterations.</li>
<li>After reading about Exception-driven development (EDD) on Hacker News, we have adopted it as a practice. The moral of the story here is that if we monitor our systems, then they will not fail.</li>
</ol>

    	<p>Startups (start-ups) are hard.</p>
<p>You are the CEO of <em>QuickHolland</em>, a company that sells instant hollandaise sauce (currently in R&amp;D) in revolutionary, squeeze-bottle form factor.</p>
<p>As a founder in a startup, you likely have several priorities to juggle:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Maintaining your vision</strong>, because it is <em>your</em> company</li>
<li><strong>Maintaining investor relations</strong>, to get advice from them (if they are on the board) or to have a constant source of funding</li>
<li><strong>Managing your day-to-day business</strong>, because, again, this company is yours to run.</li>
</ol>
<p>This post explains why it is often difficult to do all of these things.</p>
<h2 id="1-Maintaining-your-vision"><a href="#1-Maintaining-your-vision" class="headerlink" title="1. Maintaining your vision"></a>1. Maintaining your vision</h2><p>Your mother just spent an hour <a href="http://ciaoegrazie.wordpress.com/tag/gordon-ramsays-hollandaise-sauce/" target="_blank" rel="external">making hollandaise sauce from scratch</a>, and she complains to you that it was too time-consuming a thing to do in the morning–when people need to get to work on time.</p>
<p>You have an idea; a lightbulb glowed atop your head. Instant hollandaise sauce. You narrow your vision. You set your goal. You incorporate your company. And you hire on the best people you know.</p>
<p>Now what?</p>
<p><strong>Is it your job to stick to the vision, or is it sometimes appropriate to modify the company’s vision?</strong></p>
<p>One year into your saucy enterprise, you find yourself in a sticky situation, where your food scientists come up with something in a squeeze bottle, but no one is buying it. “But build it and they will come,” you think to yourself, “maybe I am not reaching the correct market.”</p>
<p>You pitch your idea to your investors and they say that your idea reeks of unoriginality. They say that it has been done before. “Is this like other hollandaise sauces out there, except <del>on social networks</del>in a squeeze bottle?” You tell them yes, but, see, the squeeze bottle is what we’re <em>really</em> selling. Your investors, agreeing with your explanation, throw money at you for another year of runway.</p>
<p><strong>Are you now selling hollandaise sauce, or are you now selling squeeze bottles?</strong></p>
<p>You go back to your team of scientists and tell them you have decided to <em>pivot</em>. To pivot is to change the direction of the company–your corporate vision has now changed. Half of your team leaves your company because they are food scientists, not petroleum engineers (who would be the people who commonly make squeeze bottles). “No matter,” you think to yourself, “I have <em>leads</em>.”</p>
<h2 id="2-Maintaining-investor-relations"><a href="#2-Maintaining-investor-relations" class="headerlink" title="2. Maintaining investor relations"></a>2. Maintaining investor relations</h2><p>You own 100% of the company, but you need some initial funding, so the first course of action, of course, is to ask family and friends for your “bootstrap” money. That money buys you time, the ability to pay lawyers and governments for business-related fees, and money to hire your first employee.</p>
<p>Of course, you will almost certainly want to hire more than one employee, so you sell your company’s <em>shares</em>, to your investors (wherever you got hold of them to begin with), for instant funding, paid back by them as <em>convertible notes</em>. With that capital, you hire your second, third, fourth employees, and so on. You know how long your <em>runway</em> is (how much money you have {div} how much money you spend per month), and so do your investors, because they request that kind of information. They give you funding because they know you have a team who can execute your idea. They give you funding because you seem like a competent leader. They give you funding because, ultimately, your company might succeed, which means more money for them.</p>
<p><strong>What if you don’t succeed?</strong></p>
<h2 id="3-Managing-your-day-to-day-business"><a href="#3-Managing-your-day-to-day-business" class="headerlink" title="3. Managing your day-to-day business"></a>3. Managing your day-to-day business</h2><p><em>QuickHolland</em> is your first business, and it is your baby. By now, you have been working on it for three years, and you have pivoted three times so far; your company now prints posters for supermarkets that sell your brilliant squeeze bottles, turning your company into an advertising agency. You still have your brilliant team of people, but only one food scientist is left at this point, because the company isn’t really making food anymore.</p>
<p>On your fourth year, you run out of funding (which is a surprising amount of time, because investors gave you only one year’s worth of money.) You cannot pay your employees for the time being, but, no matter, this too shall pass. You try very hard to look for new investors. You get about half a year worth of runway, yet again, saving the company once more.</p>
<p><strong>Are you going to pay your employees their unsettled wages? If so, how?</strong></p>
<p>Once, while swimming in Salt Lake, you encounter a young, attractive woman, who happens to be interested in you. You two share the same interests, same backgrounds, and quickly fall in love. Once she moves in, You quickly realise that you no longer have the time and patience to run and maintain the company that was once your baby and vision. Hell, it isn’t even what your mother asked for anymore.</p>
<p><strong>What comes first? Your life, or your company?</strong></p>
