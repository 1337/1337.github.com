    	<p>There is <a href="http://ecomodder.com/forum/EM-hypermiling-driving-tips-ecodriving.php" target="_blank" rel="external">a list of tips from hypermilers</a>, each one more ridiculous than the last. The list gets longer every day (108 at this point).<br>But, hey, why stop there?</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Replace your windows with thinner glass</strong><br>The only point of windows is to reduce drag. Replace them with plastic windows, which are significantly lighter. Why not? <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lamborghini_Sesto_Elemento" target="_blank" rel="external">Everyone is doing it.</a></li>
<li><strong>Tape the gaps between the doors you don’t use</strong><br>Tape your doors shut, so air does not get trapped between the door and the gaps. Top gear did it in Ukraine once, obtaining insane MPG figures.</li>
<li><strong>Strip your paint off, and replace with golf balls</strong><br>The average car carries “200 pounds” of paint (whichever pound it is). That’s a lot! Strip everything off, and replace the surface with the golf ball pattern, which <a href="http://www.franklygolf.com/golf-ball-aerodynamics.aspx" target="_blank" rel="external">reduces drag</a></li>
<li><strong>Don’t brake when turning</strong><br>Want to turn right? Turn right! You have suspensions, right? Use them! Who cares about pesky maintenance costs when you can save pennies on fuel?</li>
<li><strong>Drive only downhill, and push your car uphill</strong> (#60)<br>Driving uphill costs more fuel than driving downhill. The obvious solution is to drive exclusively downhill. And only in strong tailwinds.<br>This is actually an extension of “Push it - 2” on the original list.<br>Since you are going downhill all the time, technically you will not be needing an engine or transmission to drive your car. They are heavy components that are <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fPcAH1kupug" target="_blank" rel="external">only there to weigh you down</a>.<br>In order to measure fuel economy, you will still need a motor in your car, so carry <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONGQHupxEmk" target="_blank" rel="external">one of those</a> with you.</li>
<li><strong>Dehydrate yourself</strong><br>You are made of 70% water. Removing all water from yourself yields more than a few pennies of savings.</li>
<li><strong>Replace your tires with bicycle tires</strong> (#106)<br>Higher pressure tires give you more fuel savings. Narrower tires are also more economic. What do? Bicycle tires, obviously!<br>Don’t forget to remove as many spokes as possible, as well!</li>
<li><strong>Replace your battery</strong><br>The average lead-acid car battery can weigh kilograms. You can find some CR1025 cells that weigh 0.7 grams.</li>
<li><strong>Wait for the snow plow</strong> (#80)<br>When the snow plow arrives, don’t forget to hitch a free ride in front of it.</li>
<li><strong>Strip naked</strong> (#93)<br>“If you regularly commute to work in hot weather, you might find that (stripping) mean you can run the air conditioner a little less.”</li>
<li><strong>Only drive during the day</strong><br>What do you need to drive during the night? Lights. What do you need to power the lights? Gasoline. Smart up, people!<br>Don’t forget to disconnect your headlights so the daylight running lights don’t come on (#34).</li>
<li><strong>Drive at either 50km/h or 90km/h</strong> (#99)<br>The two are the only correct answers.</li>
<li><strong>Remove all airbags</strong><br>Did you know that 99% of all airbags manufactured end up in the landfills unused? Chances are, you have not used yours, either. Drop the weight. Porsche does this for some of their cars.</li>
<li><strong>Lower your ride</strong><br>The lower your car is, the less drag it creates from the under panels (which I assume yours are a perfectly-flat sheet of metal).</li>
<li><strong>Reduce the size of your side mirrors</strong><br>Smaller, aftermarket mirrors reduce the surface area of your car, lowering aerodynamic resistance.</li>
<li><strong>Coat your road surface with oil</strong><br>We all know road surfaces are the largest source of friction when it comes to cars travelling in a spherical vacuum. The fuel-saving solution to that is to coat your daily commute with lubricants that help maintain your speed.</li>
<li><strong>Block your grille</strong><br>If you block your grille, that means there’s no air turbulence inside. Speed speed speed!</li>
<li><strong>Remove half of your lugnuts</strong><br>If you have four nuts on each wheel, take two off from each. You will want to keep the wheels balanced, <em>obviously</em>, for fuel economy reasons, so if your wheels are imbalanced in the first place, remove lug nuts, as necessary, from whichever side the wheel is heavier.<br>Remember you are using bicycle tires, so you can find lighter rims that fit them.</li>
<li><strong>Drive in a vacuum</strong><br>You cannot drive in space, but if you could, you will encounter far less aerodynamic drag than if you were driving on Earth.<br>The solution is to find a downhill vacuum on Earth to drive in, with the exception being in tailwinds stronger than your intended speed of 50km/h.</li>
<li><strong>Drive only in New Hampshire</strong><br><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seat_belt_legislation_in_the_United_States" target="_blank" rel="external">New Hampshire has no law around seat belts</a>, which I assume you have already removed from your vehicle, along with your stereo, speakers, air conditioning unit, dashboard, power windows, every seat apart from yours, and floor board for maximum weight reduction.<br>Driving in New Hampshire, therefore, should make you the best ubermiler.</li>
<li><strong>Don’t stop at border crossings</strong><br>Braking is just wasted energy. As you approach the border crossing, simply ease your throttle until the police bring you to a complete stop.</li>
</ol>
<p>In summary, your sweet ride will have/be:</p>
<ul>
<li>An electric motor, directly connected to a hearing aid battery</li>
<li>You, in the form of a jerky</li>
<li>Plastic windows, bicycle tires, and basically nothing else</li>
<li>In New Hampshire</li>
<li>Atop a frictionless oily road</li>
<li>Accelerating downhill in a vacuum at (at most) 9.81ms<sup>-2</sup>, or</li>
<li>Travelling the wind, at 90km/h. Remember to coast with your motor off</li>
</ul>
<p>Spending exactly no fuel, you will have beaten the world record by a long shot. Given enough time, you might even beat the fuel economy of Voyager 2!</p>

    	<p><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/1g1skk/what_should_i_negotiate_when_buying_a_car/cag03zo" target="_blank" rel="external">Source</a> by /u/tjanderl. Spoiler: sometimes you don’t want to buy a used car.</p>
<p>You need to see it on a lift, remember suspension holds the wheels on and can cost between 1500 to 5000 dollars to replace.</p>
<p>To check the shocks and struts: Open car door, stand on the jam, give it a bounce, it should travel down and back up ONCE. if it does anymore the car is riding on springs, this is a 1500 dollars right off the bat, not fixing it will ruin tires and the springs.</p>
<p>Find an area to drive the car in tight circles, listen for any creeking this generally indicates bad ball joints (which can kill you) or bad bushings which will degrade handling significantly.</p>
<p>Look at it on a lift: Almost any component of the suspension that is a joint has a bushing, make sure the plastic bushings are not cracked, make sure any rubber boots are intact as well, a boot is seen where axles meet their wheel/differential, it looks like a rubber accordion and it holds oil to lubricate the joints inside, if they are cracking or damaged the oil will eventually drain and that joint will overheat and seize.</p>
<p>Don’t be afraid to pop the hood, make sure the engine bay is clean, check the oil, pull the dipstick and tap it ever so gently onto a paper towel, the oil will soak in and the dirt will sit on the towel, if there is a lot of dirt sitting on the towel it’s a good bet the oil hasn’t been changed regularly. Make sure fluid levels are OK, some used cars go right to the lot and off fluid levels are signs of improper maintenance. Proper maintenance correlates directly with engine life.</p>
<p>Listen to the engine with the hood open, you don’t want to hear any rhythmic ticking or knocking, you will however hear the mechanical flutter of the valves. No squeals should be heard either.</p>
<p>Speaking of the engine while the car is on the lift inspect any hoses you see, if they are moist and dirty looking the car has been leaking something, be it brake power steering coolant or oil. Leaks are generally cheap fixes but seeing tons of them is a sign the car was poorly maintained.</p>
<p>Inspect the body and underside for rust, non-painted items will rust like the brake rotors etc. This is fine as they are designed to or are eventually maintenance replaced parts, the body shell however shouldn’t be rusting, if it is you’re in for trouble down the line.</p>
<p>Make sure all the electronics in the car work during your test drive, most of all be thorough.</p>
<p>Anything you find wrong (and with used something always will be) is a point where you can talk down the price, don’t worry about having looked at other cars you can still bullshit them by saying “I was looking at a fairly clean and solid civic for X but I like this car more, although I see the bushings are going, that’s a pricey fix can we get that fixed at an X discount before buying?”</p>
<p>If they won’t put it on a lift open the hood or let a mechanic of your choosing inspect the car say no, these are generally crooks who want to sell you a lemon and laugh all the way to the bank.</p>
<p>If you are looking at cars in the 15,000 dollar range you are probably looking at fairly new CPOs, why not just buy a new compact car and ensure the maintenance is done properly from the beginning? You can get a civic in hatch non hatch coupe or sedan in the 17-23 range? The only reason I ask is you honestly don’t save much and can often talk a dealership down when financing a new car to almost where a CPO car is priced, they are less likely to budge down a lot on the price of a CPO or used car, the non-CPO used car market is pay way too much for a piece of shit because cash for clunkers took a lot of good used cars out of existence, as well as parts since all those cars were all scrapped.</p>
<p>Seriously if you buy new and stay dedicated to changing the oil ever 6K miles, tranny fluid 36k and every 18k after, coolant and brake fluid yearly, and power steering with the tranny any modern car will make 100K miles and 6 years without needing serious maintenance, AKA you will pay it off before you start replacing serious parts. Think about a 6 year loan on a new car with 5K down rather than looking at used, just some food for though, if you plan on owning the car for 10 years you’ll be ahead of the pains of a used car.</p>
<p>edit: Seriously consider new, here’s an example of how fucked the used car market is: A ‘99 civic in my area are selling for 8000 dollars with 80k miles, that’s 20K away from cooling system rebuild, timing belt replacement, shock/strut replacement, as well as rotors and drums and most likely not maintained well. A 2010 civic sedan Certified Pre-Owned (CPO) are going for 16,000 dollars with 15-25K miles on the clock, brand new custom ordered and delivered base-package hondas are 18,165 dollars. So let’s look at our civic options:</p>
<p>8000-dollar Civic: About to need roughly $3000 in maintenance in 2 years time, so it’ll cost you 11-12K before you wish you bought a new car…. It’s also going to eat through gas, at 100K you generally loose 3-5 MPG off the sticker and well older cars eat gas anyways. A ‘99 civic will be getting you 17 city and 25 highway. The v-tech has some seals that start to go in it as most variable valve systems do, the ECU adapts but the low-end torque always sucks once the v-tech looses it’s youth, and that’s what you use most unless you do nothing but highway miles.</p>
<p>CPO: 16,000 for a slightly used newer vehicle, chances are you won’t talk them down too far on the price since they put money into it certifying as well as most likely it being a lease someone didn’t want to buy after the terms were up, they probably made 5 grand off it and want to turn a profit on finally getting rid of the thing.</p>
<p>New: 18,000, very negotiable as you can say “Well I was looking at a new subaru that is 17,500 that I like more” and you can really haggle when buying new, plus the dealer makes more off financing a new car than anything else, they’ll take a 2K loss on the car to make 5K back. You could also order the car custom built with your favorite color paint and interior etc. you can make a spreadsheet and maintain the car correctly and get 15 years 250K miles out of it easily, plus all the modern standard amenities like bluetooth aux ports built in nav heated seats and mirrors etc.</p>
