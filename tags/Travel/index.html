    	<p>For <em>absolutely no reason whatsoever</em>, I got myself a holiday to <a href="https://www.google.com/maps/place/Tobermory,+ON" target="_blank" rel="external">Tobermory</a>, a place that my colleague said was a nice place to visit. She was right.</p>
<p>Just a few hours’ drive from wherever you think I live, and yet a few hours really isn’t the kind of time you would normally plan on wasting, I went on a drive there, again, for <em>absolutely no reason whatsoever</em>, to where the province’s national marine park lies.</p>
<p>Day one involved ending up at <a href="https://www.google.com/maps/place/Owen+Sound,+ON" target="_blank" rel="external">Owen Sound</a>, a town that tries to be a city, and subsequently travelling to Tobermory, where all the promises come true. Well, as it turned out, Owen Sound was a bit of a ghost town… at least for the parts it called downtown.</p>
<p>Ordered a takeout sushi bento for <em>absolutely no reason whatsoever</em>. For whatever reason, I always get Japanese food whenever I feel like <em>it</em>. <a href="http://yummyyummycuisine.ca/" target="_blank" rel="external">Yummy Yummy</a>, the place, half empty at the time, interestingly, was not bad. The salmon was dry and tasteless, but the rest of the bento box was great.</p>
<p>The Indian Falls was nearby, so I went there. After having just been to Elora, this manmade waterfall, (if it wasn’t manmade, it sure looks like it was.) despite its numerous defencive strategies to prevent the average hiker from reaching there (misleading paths), was underwhelming. I left soon afterwards.</p>
<p>The journey continued on with a drive to Cape Croker, apparently a native American stronghold, and the host of a lighthouse, creatively called the <a href="https://www.google.com/maps/place/Cape+Croker+Lighthouse/" target="_blank" rel="external">Cape Croker Lighthouse</a>. The path turned from tarmac to gravel, but my car journeyed on. When I arrived, it was covered with pride. And nearby cluster flies.</p>
<p>No time to waste. Time to actually go to Tobermory. I buckled up (hehe) and cruise controlled all the way to the motel, the place that claimed to be a motel, but was actually much nicer. Friendly man there explained that there was a router, but there was effectively no Wi-Fi inside my room. Nice. He also brought forth a helpful map… in retrospect, not that helpful, because “downtown” is literally that one street (Bay St.), and the big/little tubs (like bays or lagoons).</p>
<p>Well, guy said the <a href="https://www.google.com/maps/place/Big+Tub+Lighthouse/" target="_blank" rel="external">Big Tub Lighthouse</a> was 45 minutes of walking, but only 2 minutes of drive away. <em>Challenge Accepted.</em> The drive ended up to be more like four minutes, but it was fast nevertheless. The lighthouse was one of the most complete, best preserved lighthouses on this trip.</p>
<p>Had dinner at the creatively-named <a href="https://www.google.com/maps/place/The+Fish+%26+Chip+Place/@45.2547777,-81.6635033,19z/data=!4m12!1m6!3m5!1s0x0:0x14ed757805c10e4!2sThe+Coffee+Shop!8m2!3d45.2545111!4d-81.6635294!3m4!1s0x0:0x814d18d19f9ab060!8m2!3d45.2547542!4d-81.6630808" target="_blank" rel="external">“The Fish and Chip Place”</a>. It advertised Georgian Bay Whitefish, which, of course, I had to try. It tasted rather gamy. That one museum I visited later tomorrow taught me why.</p>
<p>Wait, it was 7pm and there was one more hour left until sunset. What would Jesus do? He would go to The Grotto! Driving there, the camp guard said the national park was actually closed, no one was here to handle the ticketing, and that if I were to go see The Grotto, I would be there after sunset, and it would be impossible to see anything.</p>
<p>Challenge Accepted, as usual.</p>
<p>And challenge completed.</p>
<p>The view was breathtaking. The rocks, the sun, the open bay.</p>
<p>But I knew I would be in trouble if I do not exit the national park by the time the sun actually sets, so I rushed back to my car.</p>
<p>The morning after, I purchased a light roast coffee from what they call <a href="https://www.google.com/maps/place/The+Coffee+Shop/@45.2547777,-81.6635033,19.38z/data=!4m5!3m4!1s0x0:0x14ed757805c10e4!8m2!3d45.2545111!4d-81.6635294" target="_blank" rel="external">The Coffee Shop</a>. Next, I visited the Visitors Centre, where I should have gone the night before. It was a great hike, full of interesting fungi, and to the watchtower, where I saw the largest unbroken stretch of forest in Southern Ontario.</p>
<p>Having booked a cruise to the Flowerpot Island, part of the <a href="https://www.google.com/maps/place/Fathom+Five+National+Marine+Park/@45.2825747,-81.6312099,11.92z/data=!4m5!3m4!1s0x0:0xf781ff1812dfe401!8m2!3d45.2818924!4d-81.7238617" target="_blank" rel="external">Fathom Five National Marine Park</a>, I took a glass bottom ship around the bay, the shipwreck, and the lighthouse I had visited the night before.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.google.com/maps/place/Flowerpot+Island/@45.2966019,-81.6144883,13.67z/data=!4m5!3m4!1s0x0:0xf3483ffdba2555cf!8m2!3d45.2988072!4d-81.61726" target="_blank" rel="external">The flowerpot island</a> featured three fantastic hikes, two flowerpots, and an amazing Parks Canada staff called Sheila (I think). She was just so enthusiastic about her work, despite all that it was being talking about the island, and ahanding out plastic bags all day long. She left a distinct memory in my mind. She had a very bright smile. She told me all about the island, including the plants and exotic orchids that were not flowering at the time. She loved her work. She loved Georgian Bay. She loved Canada.</p>
<p>I took place in two of the hikes. The first hike, which everyone goes on and back out of, was good. At the end was a lighthouse, or, more accurately, a lightstation, which was underwhelming compared to the sights from the viewing platform. The second hike, towards <a href="https://www.google.com/maps/place/Tobermory,+ON/@45.297085,-81.6285995,16.75z/data=!4m5!3m4!1s0x4d2d0ba9fb4f9461:0x3b2e70b0e46a3526!8m2!3d45.2533625!4d-81.6645411" target="_blank" rel="external">Marl Bed</a>, a place so hidden it is not even visible on Google Maps, was a bit more difficult. With 50 minutes left to spare before the return ship arrives, I ventured on.</p>
<p>Jesus <em>does</em> provide.</p>
<p>The express ship back was nothing short of exciting; thank the cruise booking staff for “accidentally” booking this ship for me, so that I had two hours of hiking time. And thank her for booking the fast ship back, for it was a unique(ly exciting) experience on a choppy sea.</p>
<p>On my way back, I visited Inglis Falls, the place I had missed completely on my way to Owen Sound. It looked a lot better than Indian Falls. Of course, after having been to Banff, nothing really quite surprised me.</p>
<p>All this, I was incredibly lucky in visiting the area while taking a weekday off. Had I not done that, it would have been packed with people everywhere I go. A weekday trip made the town exquisite, pleasant, and photogenic as well.</p>
<p>The overall fuel consumption was 6.05 L/100km. It will probably never hit that low again.</p>

    	<p>Continuing from <a href="/2016/Calgary-The-Journey/">my trip to Calgary</a>, I rented a car, drove to the Rockies, and had the time of my life. At a huge cost. Story below.</p>
<h1 id="Day-1-Johnston-Canyon-Lake-Louise"><a href="#Day-1-Johnston-Canyon-Lake-Louise" class="headerlink" title="Day 1: Johnston Canyon / Lake Louise"></a>Day 1: Johnston Canyon / Lake Louise</h1><p>In the company of a righteous man in the eyes of the Lord, his fiancee at the time, her brother, and her three best friends, I drove along to Banff National Park, the first city I have encountered that has an entrance fee. The fee is also calculated in a very odd manner: by paying ~$10 per day per person, you get a single receipt which you must affix to your vehicle. (So… should I hide all my passengers?) This same receipt can also be used as a museum pass, but you must keep the receipt affixed to the car. (Which means you can never use it)</p>
<p>Anyway, we hiked.</p>
<p><img src="/image/banff/image147.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p>It became immediately clear that I was too old for moderate-altitude hiking. Twenty year-old peers championed the rocks with ease; I felt large rocks on my chest. The resulting scenery was worthy of the exercise.</p>
<p><img src="/image/banff/image146.jpg" alt=""><br><img src="/image/banff/image145.jpg" alt=""><br><img src="/image/banff/image144.jpg" alt=""><br><img src="/image/banff/image142.jpg" alt=""><br><img src="/image/banff/image129.jpg" alt=""><br><img src="/image/banff/image123.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p>This is the closest hiking trail from Calgary (I think?) making it also the most crowded. That did not stop us from exploring the waterfall at the end of it:</p>
<p><img src="/image/banff/image122.jpg" alt=""><br><img src="/image/banff/image118.jpg" alt=""><br><img src="/image/banff/image116.jpg" alt=""><br><img src="/image/banff/image115.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p>That part of the trail is called the Lower Falls. This is called the LGBTQ tree.</p>
<p><img src="/image/banff/image114.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p>After the hike, we had, some for the first time, “afternoon tea”. At an amazing cost, you receive three plates worth of desserts, as well as your personal pot of tea. I had the Safari something; it was good.</p>
<p>(No meaningful pictures taken during the meal)</p>
<p>The weather was acting up at the time, so Lake Louise gave a mediocre impression. (Spoiler: I went back)</p>
<p><img src="/image/banff/image105.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p>After Lake Louise, the six travellers returned to Calgary, where they intended to stay for the week. I drove to Banff (town proper), and I intended to stay for the week.</p>
<p>It was a beautiful, beautiful town. Also a simple one. Essentially a tourist attraction, the entire town is centered around its main street, whose upper portion was solely occupied by hotels and accommodations, and whose lower portion was solely occupied by attractions like shops, museums, and parks.</p>
<p>Even in the rain, the sights were breathtaking. (The altitude was also breathtaking.) So many Europeans. Swiss, English, German, and Dutch!</p>
<p><img src="/image/banff/image99.jpg" alt=""></p>
<h1 id="Day-2-Two-Jack-Lake-Lake-Minnewanka-Gondola-Cave-and-Basin-Whyte-Museum"><a href="#Day-2-Two-Jack-Lake-Lake-Minnewanka-Gondola-Cave-and-Basin-Whyte-Museum" class="headerlink" title="Day 2: Two Jack Lake, Lake Minnewanka, Gondola, Cave and Basin, Whyte Museum"></a>Day 2: Two Jack Lake, Lake Minnewanka, Gondola, Cave and Basin, Whyte Museum</h1><p>With the forecast being rain for the day, I woke up early for a drive to Two Jack Lake, which was a beautiful place, with only a few Asians fiddling about.</p>
<p><img src="/image/banff/image420.jpg" alt=""><br><img src="/image/banff/image415.jpg" alt=""><br><img src="/image/banff/image414.jpg" alt=""><br><img src="/image/banff/image412.jpg" alt=""><br><img src="/image/banff/image411.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p>The next destination was Lake Minnewanka, which, according to what I had overheard from a tour guide around at the time, was a man-made lake. “Oh wow,” I thought to myself, “I should get a tour guide to get the most out of this trip.” I didn’t.</p>
<p><img src="/image/banff/image410.jpg" alt=""><br><img src="/image/banff/image406.jpg" alt=""><br><img src="/image/banff/image403.jpg" alt=""><br><img src="/image/banff/image402.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p>The rain had not subsided entirely; I kept my activities in-town.</p>
<p>The ferris-wheel-on-a-chain Gondola was one of the things each tourist should see. I, having just bitten the inside of my mouth at the base of the station, got irrationally annoyed, and abandoned the idea in the process. But I was there.</p>
<p><img src="/image/banff/image388.jpg" alt=""><br><img src="/image/banff/image392.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p>Where else can you go on a rainy day? Museums, I suppose. The museums in Banff are interesting. The first one I went to was the <a href="http://www.pc.gc.ca/eng/lhn-nhs/ab/caveandbasin/index.aspx" target="_blank" rel="external">Cave and Basin</a>, which was more park than museum.</p>
<p><img src="/image/banff/image71.jpg" alt=""><br><img src="/image/banff/image79.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p>The <em>Cave</em> was a hole in the ground. Inside the cave was a pool of water, which smelled like sulphur (hydrogen sulphide). The experience was unique to me.</p>
<p><img src="/image/banff/image91.jpg" alt=""><br><img src="/image/banff/image90.jpg" alt=""><br><img src="/image/banff/image86.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p>The <em>Basin</em> was effectively a pool of hot spring water, also full of minerals. They claim that <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Banff_Springs_snail" target="_blank" rel="external">endangered snails</a> live in the water. Despite the staff pointing into the (cess)pool, I could not see any.</p>
<p><img src="/image/banff/image85.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p>Inside the park was also a recreation of what was supposedly the first hotel in Banff.</p>
<p><img src="/image/banff/image73.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p>Next, I went to the Whyte museum, which I would not reasonably recommend. If you want history, go to Glenbow museum. If you want fun, go outside. Nevertheless, being a boring place, it attracts many rainy-day elderly people. Here are some pictures of the museum.</p>
<p><img src="/image/banff/image61.jpg" alt=""><br><img src="/image/banff/image67.jpg" alt=""><br><img src="/image/banff/image64.jpg" alt=""><br><img src="/image/banff/image63.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p>Nearing the end of the day, I returned to town with an empty stomach. From the supermarket (the Safeway is now an IGA), I purchased a piece of “pure AAA western beef”. Using the recipe <a href="http://www.marthastewart.com/343792/pan-fried-steak" target="_blank" rel="external">most available at the time</a>, I pan-fried it with seasoning. It was glorious.</p>
<p><img src="/image/banff/image59.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p>(No meaningful pictures taken during the meal)</p>
<h1 id="Day-3-Moraine-Lake-Lake-Louise-Bow-Lake-Peyto-Lake"><a href="#Day-3-Moraine-Lake-Lake-Louise-Bow-Lake-Peyto-Lake" class="headerlink" title="Day 3: Moraine Lake, Lake Louise, Bow Lake, Peyto Lake"></a>Day 3: Moraine Lake, Lake Louise, Bow Lake, Peyto Lake</h1><p>It’s Lake Day! I began my <a href="https://www.google.ca/maps/dir/Banff,+AB/Moraine+Lake,+Improvement+District+No.+9,+AB/Lake+Louise,+AB/Bow+Lake,+Improvement+District+No.+9,+AB/Peyto+Lake,+Improvement+District+No.+9,+AB/Banff,+AB/@51.4410197,-116.3268833,10z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m38!4m37!1m5!1m1!1s0x5370ca45910c4afd:0xcaafaebedaac9463!2m2!1d-115.5707694!2d51.1783629!1m5!1m1!1s0x53775bcbf58ee517:0x42c8a7a2c3c05c95!2m2!1d-116.1860049!2d51.3217416!1m5!1m1!1s0x53775d28a0e1ce11:0x3c373c7b6365bce6!2m2!1d-116.1773193!2d51.4253851!1m5!1m1!1s0x5377798c82924145:0xee9f124083b5d300!2m2!1d-116.460027!2d51.6712779!1m5!1m1!1s0x537778716d70aaaf:0xa7adc4f7892b437b!2m2!1d-116.5226977!2d51.7255153!1m5!1m1!1s0x5370ca45910c4afd:0xcaafaebedaac9463!2m2!1d-115.5707694!2d51.1783629!3e0" target="_blank" rel="external">250km journey</a> early in the morning. The day would be sunny (most places), so I planned the day outdoors.</p>
<p>Moraine Lake was by far the most beautiful:</p>
<p><img src="/image/banff/image370.jpg" alt=""><br><img src="/image/banff/image364.jpg" alt=""><br><img src="/image/banff/image53.jpg" alt=""><br><img src="/image/banff/image52.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p>I attempted to take a mount of rocks that was at the base of the lake. It produced some of the best pictures I have taken on this trip. But it was also the coldest (-1 C in June? What) so I could not stay for long. Bizarrely, Lake Louise, which is just 10km away, was much warmer at the time, so I went for a complete hike there, from one end of the lake, to the opposite end.</p>
<p><img src="/image/banff/image362.jpg" alt=""><br><img src="/image/banff/image361.jpg" alt=""><br><img src="/image/banff/image360.jpg" alt=""><br><img src="/image/banff/image358.jpg" alt=""><br><img src="/image/banff/image354.jpg" alt=""><br><img src="/image/banff/image351.jpg" alt=""><br><img src="/image/banff/image349.jpg" alt=""><br><img src="/image/banff/image343.jpg" alt=""><br><img src="/image/banff/image339.jpg" alt=""><br><img src="/image/banff/image335.jpg" alt=""><br><img src="/image/banff/image334.jpg" alt=""><br><img src="/image/banff/image333.jpg" alt=""><br><img src="/image/banff/image331.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p>The opposite end of the lake could be walked on; it had a solid clay foundation. Beyond the clay, there was a spot for climbers, and a lot of<br>warning signs about wild bears.</p>
<p>My next step was Bow Lake, which was a short drive north of Lake Louise. It was less famous for obvious reasons.</p>
<p><img src="/image/banff/image43.jpg" alt=""><br><img src="/image/banff/image42.jpg" alt=""><br><img src="/image/banff/image41.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p>There are no real restaurants along the way, so I packed a number of snacks for the day. The final destination of the day was Peyto Lake, which could/should be seen from Bow Summit, another one of the Bow places one must experience.</p>
<p><img src="/image/banff/image38.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p>Bow Summit was a sharp climb, but also a rewarding one. Atop the summit, you see a lake so blue, it may seem unreal:</p>
<p><img src="/image/banff/image36.jpg" alt=""><br><img src="/image/banff/image34.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p>To use <a href="http://banffandbeyond.com/is-peyto-lake-really-that-blue/" target="_blank" rel="external">the words of Audrey the blogger</a>: “Peyto Lake really is that blue? Yes it is!”</p>
<h1 id="Day-4-Banff-Park-Museum-Bow-Falls-Banff-Downtown-Tunnel-Mountain-Trail"><a href="#Day-4-Banff-Park-Museum-Bow-Falls-Banff-Downtown-Tunnel-Mountain-Trail" class="headerlink" title="Day 4: Banff Park Museum, Bow Falls, Banff Downtown, Tunnel Mountain Trail"></a>Day 4: Banff Park Museum, Bow Falls, Banff Downtown, Tunnel Mountain Trail</h1><p>Taking a break from all that driving, I stayed largely in town on Thursday.</p>
<p>A lady by the name of “Lisa” may be delighted to learn that there is, in fact, a museum about itself: the Banff Park Museum.</p>
<p><img src="/image/banff/image30.jpg" alt=""><br><img src="/image/banff/image29.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p>The museum also had other interesting exhibits, such as taxidermy birds, elks, goats, and bears. They claim to have placed them exactly how they have always been placed, including having random specimens cluttered here and there, because the museum is a museum about itself, and this was how the museum has always been. Can’t argue with that.</p>
<p><img src="/image/banff/image26.jpg" alt=""><br><img src="/image/banff/image27.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p>Next was a hike down the Bow River Trail and the Bow Falls trail, leading to… Bow Falls. Strangely enough, I have lost all pictures of the actual hike and the fall itself, so you may consult <a href="https://www.google.ca/search?q=bow+falls" target="_blank" rel="external">Google</a> for pictures. The only surviving picture is of a fake Indian tribe leader, looking for “donations” from passersby.</p>
<p><img src="/image/banff/image23.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p>After the hike, I returned downtown. Downtown Banff is a strange, and beautiful place. They have a <em>THE</em> PRESBYTERIAN CHURCH IN CANADA, majestic since 1830, and a “Banff Avenue Square” that is, rather amusingly, a circle.</p>
<p><img src="/image/banff/image24.jpg" alt=""><br><img src="/image/banff/image25.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p>Finally, when the day was about to end (that being 6pm), I went for an in-town hike at Tunnel Mountain. The inclination was ridiculous (40 degrees uphill in the beginning?), but it got easier as I ascended.</p>
<p><img src="/image/banff/image321.jpg" alt=""><br><img src="/image/banff/image315.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p>The view got better and better, until I finally reached the peak:</p>
<p><img src="/image/banff/image313.jpg" alt=""><br><img src="/image/banff/image21.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p>I will never forget that hike. It was worth every second of my life.</p>
<h1 id="Day-5-Athabasca-Glacier-Athabasca-Falls-Jasper-Maligne-Canyon"><a href="#Day-5-Athabasca-Glacier-Athabasca-Falls-Jasper-Maligne-Canyon" class="headerlink" title="Day 5: Athabasca Glacier, Athabasca Falls, Jasper, Maligne Canyon"></a>Day 5: Athabasca Glacier, Athabasca Falls, Jasper, Maligne Canyon</h1><p>Time for <a href="https://www.google.ca/maps/dir/Banff,+AB/Athabasca+Glacier,+Improvement+District+No.+12,+AB/Athabasca+Falls,+Improvement+District+No.+12,+AB/Maligne+Canyon,+Jasper,+AB/Banff,+AB/@52.034266,-117.9529196,8z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m32!4m31!1m5!1m1!1s0x5370ca45910c4afd:0xcaafaebedaac9463!2m2!1d-115.5707694!2d51.1783629!1m5!1m1!1s0x5377fee52d26aa55:0x3c5ddc282519d267!2m2!1d-117.2578206!2d52.1897234!1m5!1m1!1s0x5382cd919bef9cc3:0x543efdf2eee36be6!2m2!1d-117.8837672!2d52.664437!1m5!1m1!1s0x539cd49b6d7b1429:0x8f2153bb15fed8f5!2m2!1d-118.0039705!2d52.9199289!1m5!1m1!1s0x5370ca45910c4afd:0xcaafaebedaac9463!2m2!1d-115.5707694!2d51.1783629!3e0" target="_blank" rel="external">more driving</a>. Eight hours of it! The brokeback (literal) journey would get me to Jasper, another town you need to pay to get into, and whatever it was it had to offer that one of my colleagues raved so much about. But first, I must drive two hours to each Peyto Lake, where one can exit the vehicle and stretch for air.</p>
<p>The drive along the <a href="http://www.icefieldsparkway.ca/" target="_blank" rel="external">Icefields Parkway</a> was a beautiful, but an extremely boring one. Lasting 232km, you see mountains rivers, beyond which, more mountains and rivers. Sometimes dried riverbeds. No surprises. The two-lane highway forces the driver (me) to pass trailers while crossing to the opposite side of the road. Had it not been a Hyundai Accident with something like a 1.6L engine on eco, it could have been less of a thrill. After an hour of convincing myself that I was still awake (or even alive), I arrived at the Columbia Icefields area. Yes, the <a href="http://athletics.uwaterloo.ca/sports/2010/7/21/Columbia_Icefield.aspx" target="_blank" rel="external">Columbia Ice Field</a> was named after it, because that stupid school loves references. The real ice field was breathtaking, again, because it was 2.5km above sea level, and it was the right altitude for the average human to be out of breath.</p>
<p><img src="/image/banff/image308.jpg" alt=""><br><img src="/image/banff/image307.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p>Maybe Columbia Icefields isn’t Athabasca Glacier. But to me, it was close enough. I went a glacier; it was amazingly accessible. You can even see tours <em>on</em> the glacier, for the more adventurous. It was too cold and windy to take a steady photo, but the experience was surreal. Highly recommended destination!</p>
<p><img src="/image/banff/image305.jpg" alt=""><br><img src="/image/banff/image303.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p>Another 45 minutes of driving brought me to Athabasca Falls. Unlike other falls in this country, the fall itself was not the attraction; its surreal rock formation was.</p>
<p><img src="/image/banff/image448.jpg" alt=""><br><img src="/image/banff/image449.jpg" alt=""><br><img src="/image/banff/image450.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p>And, finally, following another half an hour of driving, the journey ended in Jasper, a friendly town that spells out everything. I took a picture of a restaurant. You might know what type of restaurant it is.</p>
<p><img src="/image/banff/image441.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p>The town has a town square that looks a bit like Victoria Park. It also has an old, preserved train station that is <em>actually</em> still a train station, with a Greyhound station inside of it.</p>
<p><img src="/image/banff/image442.jpg" alt=""><br><img src="/image/banff/image443.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p>A few minutes outside of town was Maligne Canyon, the #2 destination, according to TripAdvisor. Indeed, it was the second best hike I have ever had. The canyon was deep, and its growth of lichens along the way reminded me that this place has regular, harsh winters.</p>
<p><img src="/image/banff/image451.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p>And, after all that, I was content with my trip. I have had the time of my life. Now, a four-hour drive home (Banff)…</p>
<h1 id="Return-to-Calgary"><a href="#Return-to-Calgary" class="headerlink" title="Return to Calgary"></a>Return to Calgary</h1><p>The dawn of Saturday marked my return to Calgary, where a righteous man in the eyes of the Lord were to marry a woman, also righteous in the eyes of the Lord, but shall both remain anonymous (unless I have the permission to associate with their identities), in holy matrimony. I attended the wedding. Of course, since I have no business posting other people’s faces on the Internet, there shall be no pictures. Here are two pandas without eyes…</p>
<p><img src="/image/banff/image12.jpg" alt=""></p>
<h1 id="The-real-cost"><a href="#The-real-cost" class="headerlink" title="The real cost"></a>The real cost</h1><p>This was the first time I drove in the province of Alberta, and the first time I have ever rented a car. Guess what I did on the first day? Paid too much attention to the speed cameras, and ran a red light. Not sure what that proves.</p>

    	<p>Some time ago, I flew to Calgary for personal business. <a href="http://pason.com/" target="_blank" rel="external">Having been to Calgary before</a>, and having it been the winter at the time, and having it been when I could not drive at the time: it was dreadful. Calgary was remembered as an awful place. I had no family, I had no friends, I had no ways to get around. Hell, I did not even have a proper hat. This summer, I gave the city a second chance.</p>
<p>This was the plane.</p>
<p><img src="/image/banff/image299.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p>The flight arrived late. Having gotten lost at the (ever so familiar) airport, I could not catch the airport bus to the city centre. Thankfully, a righteous man in the eyes of the Lord drove me to the hostel, which was ugly on the outside, as advertised, but also <a href="http://www.wickedhostel.com/" target="_blank" rel="external">wicked</a> inside, as advertised.</p>
<p><img src="/image/banff/image297.jpg" alt=""><br><img src="/image/banff/image227.jpg" alt=""><br><img src="/image/banff/image295.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p>They also had a place for free food; I was a contributor.</p>
<p><img src="/image/banff/image296.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p>In the following morning, after tasting vegemite for the first time, I went out for a city tour. The first stop was the Saddledome (there are apparently many of them, so this is the Scotiabank Saddledome.)</p>
<p><img src="/image/banff/image439.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p>Since it was the morning, and that the Saddledome is a stadium, the place was actually empty.</p>
<p><img src="/image/banff/image292.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p>Outside the Saddledome, many native (“first nations people”) displays were also present. Take this one, for example:</p>
<p><img src="/image/banff/image287.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p>It was a podium of sorts, but on the other side, it says it was the global petroleum show, which might be confusing:</p>
<p><img src="/image/banff/image289.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p>In fact, the entire city was crazy about petroleum. Almost every other thing was about oil. More about that later.</p>
<p><img src="/image/banff/image438.jpg" alt=""><br><img src="/image/banff/image286.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p>Did I say later? Oops, I headed to Heritage Park, and apparently the park was <em>also</em> about oil. It was called the Gasoline Alley.</p>
<h1 id="Heritage-Park"><a href="#Heritage-Park" class="headerlink" title="Heritage Park"></a>Heritage Park</h1><p><img src="/image/banff/image436.jpg" alt=""><br><img src="/image/banff/image435.jpg" alt=""><br><img src="/image/banff/image431.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p>The Gasoline Alley featured a grand display of… gasoline, and gasoline accessories, throughout the history of gasoline.</p>
<p><img src="/image/banff/image428.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heritage_Park_Historical_Village" target="_blank" rel="external">The Park</a> was about the story of old Western Canada. If you have watched the third Back to the Future movie (and believe in its existence), then it was a bit like that. Classic buildings everywhere, a working railway system that brings guests around the living museum, and a ferry that does a figure 8 inside a reservoir. It was amazing.</p>
<p><img src="/image/banff/image425.jpg" alt=""><br><img src="/image/banff/image424.jpg" alt=""><br><img src="/image/banff/image423.jpg" alt=""><br><img src="/image/banff/image271.jpg" alt=""><br><img src="/image/banff/image264.jpg" alt=""><br><img src="/image/banff/image270.jpg" alt=""><br><img src="/image/banff/image256.jpg" alt=""><br><img src="/image/banff/image248.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p>Again, since the park may well be closed during the Winter, Calgary is essentially no good from September onwards.</p>
<p>One of the things that makes this park special is its living staff; when you enter a building, not only do you get to get in a building, you may also chat with the staff in the building, who pretend to be teachers/priests/policemen/doctors of the time. It may take some time to get used to.</p>
<p><img src="/image/banff/image232.jpg" alt=""><br><img src="/image/banff/image251.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p>There was a ferry that goes nowhere, so I went on it.</p>
<p><img src="/image/banff/image246.jpg" alt=""><br><img src="/image/banff/image242.jpg" alt=""><br><img src="/image/banff/image240.jpg" alt=""><br><img src="/image/banff/image235.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p><img src="/image/banff/image230.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p>To anyone interested, I cannot recommend Heritage Park enough. Although you may have to talk to every single staff to get the most out of the experience, it is open from May onwards, I believe.</p>
<h1 id="Recreating-the-past"><a href="#Recreating-the-past" class="headerlink" title="Recreating the past"></a>Recreating the past</h1><p>The rest of the weekend consisted of exploring the previously explored. I took the CTrain (day passes are ideal) place after place, to relive the past I relished.</p>
<p>The liquor store was still there. Believe me, it was necessary.</p>
<p><img src="/image/banff/image437.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p>Similarly, the A&amp;W that had always cured my hangovers, was also still there.</p>
<p><img src="/image/banff/image281.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p>I had taken many photos during my last visit; some of them were set to be renewed. Here are some before/after pictures from this visit:</p>
<p><img src="/image/IMG_1263.JPG" alt=""><br><img src="/image/banff/image168.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p>Co-op’s logo has changed.</p>
<p><img src="/image/IMG_1264.JPG" alt=""><br><img src="/image/banff/image279.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p>The price of the coffee has also changed. It was also the summer, so the Tim Hortons did not function as a cold shelter like it did last visit.</p>
<p><img src="/image/banff/image276.jpg" alt=""></p>
<h1 id="Around-the-city-in-48-hours"><a href="#Around-the-city-in-48-hours" class="headerlink" title="Around the city in 48 hours"></a>Around the city in 48 hours</h1><p>If you are willing to sacrifice a bit of time, it is possible to tour the city in 48 hours, without a vehicle (which is ironic, considering the CTrain does not run on diesel.) In my case, I went to the Glenbow Museum (which was also oil-focused), Chinatown, the Bow River pathway, and outside the Calgary Zoo.</p>
<h2 id="Glenbow-Museum"><a href="#Glenbow-Museum" class="headerlink" title="Glenbow Museum"></a>Glenbow Museum</h2><p>I have been to the Glenbow museum before; not much has changed. There is no need to return.</p>
<p><img src="/image/banff/image196.jpg" alt=""><br><img src="/image/banff/image173.jpg" alt=""><br><img src="/image/banff/image194.jpg" alt=""><br><img src="/image/banff/image192.jpg" alt=""><br><img src="/image/banff/image188.jpg" alt=""><br><img src="/image/banff/image180.jpg" alt=""><br><img src="/image/banff/image176.jpg" alt=""><br><img src="/image/banff/image175.jpg" alt=""></p>
<h2 id="Chinatown"><a href="#Chinatown" class="headerlink" title="Chinatown"></a>Chinatown</h2><p>Chinatown consists of a cluster of Asian restaurants, which have since turned from Chinese to Vietnamese, and a park called the Sien Lok Park. If you have never been to Sien Lok Park, do try and read the message under the statue there.</p>
<p><img src="/image/banff/image221.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p>This is the Asian beacon:</p>
<p><img src="/image/banff/image201.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p>And this is the inside of a church.</p>
<p><img src="/image/banff/image200.jpg" alt=""></p>
<h2 id="Calgary-Zoo-hike"><a href="#Calgary-Zoo-hike" class="headerlink" title="Calgary Zoo hike"></a>Calgary Zoo hike</h2><p>The zoo would cost me $25, so I did not enter it this time. With that said, you may see the dinosaurs still there from the outside:</p>
<p><img src="/image/banff/image163.jpg" alt=""><br><img src="/image/banff/image160.jpg" alt=""><br><img src="/image/banff/image159.jpg" alt=""><br><img src="/image/banff/image158.jpg" alt=""></p>
<h2 id="Bow-River-pathway"><a href="#Bow-River-pathway" class="headerlink" title="Bow River pathway"></a>Bow River pathway</h2><p>Calgary has beautiful summers. Its extensive pedestrian pathways are testament to it. It makes downtown Toronto look like a dump. (Well, even without comparison, downtown Toronto looks like a dump.)</p>
<p><img src="/image/banff/image220.jpg" alt=""><br><img src="/image/banff/image218.jpg" alt=""><br><img src="/image/banff/image216.jpg" alt=""><br><img src="/image/banff/image214.jpg" alt=""><br><img src="/image/banff/image211.jpg" alt=""><br><img src="/image/banff/image210.jpg" alt=""><br><img src="/image/banff/image209.jpg" alt=""></p>
