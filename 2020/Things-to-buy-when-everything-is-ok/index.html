    	<p>2020 is surely an excellent year for everyone (for better or for worse). Viruses, stock market crashes, recessions, and now protests are breaking out. There were so many things I wish I did ahead of time, including preparing myself appropriately. By <em>no</em> means stockpile useless items like toilet paper, here are some things you can buy <em>before</em> life hits you hard.</p>
<h2 id="Survival-packs"><a href="#Survival-packs" class="headerlink" title="Survival packs"></a>Survival packs</h2><p>It is really, really hard to order survival kits when Amazon is backlogged and takes a month to ship anything. They also get stupid expensive because everybody wants one, so buy these things way ahead of time. You don’t need to use it. Unless you have food inside, survival kits don’t expire.</p>
<h2 id="Car-Repairs"><a href="#Car-Repairs" class="headerlink" title="Car Repairs"></a>Car Repairs</h2><p>In the case of mass protests and viral outbreaks, you may need to escape your residence, so you really don’t want to have to book an appointment for an oil change before you can hit the road.</p>
<p>Realistically speaking, since you can store gasoline for at most six months (<a href="https://www.readersdigest.ca/cars/maintenance/old-gas-in-tank/" target="_blank" rel="external">the octane rating gets wacky</a>), you cannot go far by car even if you want to.</p>
<h2 id="Gold-and-gold-stocks"><a href="#Gold-and-gold-stocks" class="headerlink" title="Gold and gold stocks"></a>Gold and gold stocks</h2><p>Gold is usually cheaper to buy when fiat currencies aren’t crashing and burning from indefinite QE and riots and trade wars. Since gold is intrinsically worth much more than the dollar (despite also having as much value as society gives it), gold holds value relative to an inflating currency, almost guaranteeing a relative rise in value over time.</p>
<p>But you can’t buy gold when everyone else is panic-buying gold as well.</p>
<p>Buying gold stocks allows you to earn dividends when gold depreciates, which is most of the time during economic growth.</p>
<h2 id="Gun-company-stocks"><a href="#Gun-company-stocks" class="headerlink" title="Gun company stocks"></a>Gun company stocks</h2><p>When protests break out, especially in the US, people rush to buy guns. You don’t have to agree with a gun company to profit from it. In fact, by buying gun company stocks low and selling high, you potentially hurt the company (albeit not by much) by costing it dividends when it needed money the most.</p>
<p>In June 2020, “American Outdoor Brands Corporation” aka Smith &amp; Wesson rose 10% on a single day.</p>
<h2 id="Solar-panels"><a href="#Solar-panels" class="headerlink" title="Solar panels"></a>Solar panels</h2><p>I have always wanted some. Depending on which ones you get, they are going to be useful even after uncertain times.</p>
