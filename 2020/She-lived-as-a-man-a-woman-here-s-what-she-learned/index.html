    	<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrYx7HaUlMY" target="_blank" rel="external">Paula Stone Williams</a> was a man and now a transgender woman. By living life on both sides, she gets to see the world… at least from more perspectives than most of us. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gas-kL_AjSQ" target="_blank" rel="external">Other trans people speak out</a>, too. Let’s see what they have to say, before and after changing gender.</p>
<h1 id="Life-as-a-man-pros"><a href="#Life-as-a-man-pros" class="headerlink" title="Life as a man, pros"></a>Life as a man, pros</h1><ul>
<li>People respect you.</li>
<li>People take (you, and what you talk about) seriously. This eliminates a man’s need to doubt himself.</li>
<li>People don’t assume you are stupid.</li>
<li>Men typically aren’t mean to other men.</li>
<li>Men don’t need to apologise for being right.</li>
<li>Men don’t have periods. They also never hurt due to pregnancy and childbirth.</li>
<li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g-92FZPNWNs" target="_blank" rel="external">People rarely spike your drinks</a>. Although male rape does exist, it is reported much less frequently.</li>
<li>Women don’t (sexually) harass you or, to a lesser extent, your appearance.</li>
<li>It is not scary to walk alone at night.</li>
<li>Typically, no makeup is required to appear normal.</li>
<li>A man’s <a href="https://www.quora.com/What-are-the-pros-and-cons-of-being-a-girl-vs-being-a-guy#" target="_blank" rel="external">attractiveness</a> does not drop off sharply at age 30.</li>
<li>It is much easier for you to pursue a leadership role if you are a man.</li>
<li>The vast majority of organised religions don’t oppress men.</li>
</ul>
<p>The little things:</p>
<ul>
<li>Jeans pockets can actually hold things.</li>
<li>Things never fall out of any pocket.</li>
<li>Male skin is thicker and more protective.</li>
<li>Clothing sizing numbers actually mean something.</li>
</ul>
<h1 id="Life-as-a-woman-pros"><a href="#Life-as-a-woman-pros" class="headerlink" title="Life as a woman, pros"></a>Life as a woman, pros</h1><ul>
<li>It is okay to be short (being fat is another thing, but at least you can control it).</li>
<li>Haircuts are required less often.</li>
<li>Women live longer.</li>
<li>Women can choose to be fabulous.</li>
<li>When it comes to dating, you get plenty of choices.</li>
<li>Women are far less lonely in this world, and share their feelings and affection.</li>
<li>A woman’s value is not derived from her ability to provide.</li>
<li>A woman’s occupation is cleaner on average, mainly skewed by some men working sewage, mining, construction, and other forms of hard labour.</li>
<li><a href="https://www.quora.com/What-are-the-pros-and-cons-of-being-a-girl-vs-being-a-guy#" target="_blank" rel="external">Less is expected of women</a>: the world is not on their shoulders. Women do not <em>need</em> (at least seen by society) to do great things, and to achieve great heights in their careers.</li>
<li>It is socially acceptable to shop as much as you want and not care about your spending habits.</li>
<li>Women are free to be emotional—even weak—if so desired.</li>
<li>Women can have children, if that’s what you want.</li>
<li>Getting lighter sentences for crimes like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rape_by_gender#Rape_of_males_by_females" target="_blank" rel="external">rape</a> is among the social, political, and legal double standards that prefer women, such as custody.</li>
<li>In most countries, women are never conscripted for war.</li>
</ul>
<p><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/unpopularopinion/comments/hm1sce/as_a_woman_it_irritates_me_how_other_women_wont/fx2u417/" target="_blank" rel="external">/u/Zenla8282 put it nicely</a>: I think both men and women have it harder and easier in different ways, but usually when life gets tough, most of us don’t think “wow my life is so hard <em>because</em> I’m a woman/man”.</p>
