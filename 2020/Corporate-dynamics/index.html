    	<p>Someone who works at a big company shared his experience working there.</p>
<p>Your boss is not going to fire you because:</p>
<ul>
<li>Your boss doesn’t pay you. That money comes from the heavens. It is not in his interest to save money.</li>
<li>Firing someone often negatively impacts team morale.</li>
<li>Once your position is gone, it could be gone forever. As a team leader from the higher-ups’ point of view, the bigger the team is, the more successful your boss is, as long as you (not them) get the job done.</li>
<li>If a series of layoffs is announced, you can act as buffer for the rest of the team, and be laid off <em>then</em>.</li>
<li>A company often issues shares to a team proportional to its size. If you are around doing nothing, a team of ten can be granted 1000 shares, but each person may get 111 shares while you get 0.</li>
<li>Ultimately, it is not your boss’s priority to make their team efficient. All it needs to do is to deliver a lot, to <em>make themself look good</em> so they get a promotion for managing a great team. Your boss will do nothing to you unless you get in <em>their</em> personal way.</li>
</ul>
<p>You should be as lazy as your team’s average member.</p>
<ul>
<li>Go out for lunch with your team. Take as long as you feel like. Take coffee breaks as well. Make sure you poop on company time. If you <em>don’t</em> do as they do, then you are telling the boss that everybody else is slacking off, and that is not a good look for the team or the boss.</li>
</ul>
<p>Everyone will try to keep secrets from you because:</p>
<ul>
<li>Everything you don’t know is something they <em>do</em> know. And if that something matters to the company (e.g. a critical process or know-how), then knowing that information makes you un-fire-able.</li>
</ul>
<p>The lack of a method of (rightful) dismissal reduces the company’s ability to keep its employees on their toes. While there are always hardworking individuals who are self-motivated, being un-fire-able certainly encourages complacency of the lazy. Big companies systematically attract the less motivated, and that’s what we should be mindful of when finding a new place to work. Whether you personally find this desirable is down to personal preference.</p>
