    	<p>My landlord is letting his place go on sale. This also means my eviction is in order (and, given the reason, has a very generous notice required by law). It is time to revisit what it was like to live in an apartment, and what people with similar experiences gained/missed.</p>
<h1 id="Pros"><a href="#Pros" class="headerlink" title="Pros"></a>Pros</h1><ol>
<li>Stairs optional.</li>
<li>Parking is usually underground. With locks.</li>
<li>Gated entry guaranteed.</li>
<li>Usually more to see out of windows (unless you rent the basement)</li>
<li>Laundry en suite or in building is almost guaranteed.</li>
<li>There may be other amenities like a fitness room, grocery store, and even a pool. Excellent for people wanting/waiting to die here.</li>
<li>The power will probably never go out. If the power goes out, poor old grannies will be trapped, and they probably won’t let that happen.</li>
<li>No snow. No grass.</li>
</ol>
<h1 id="Cons"><a href="#Cons" class="headerlink" title="Cons"></a>Cons</h1><ol>
<li>You have to share the lift. And if anyone comes in, you have to pretend you know them and smile.</li>
<li>Possible noise from upstairs or downstairs.</li>
<li>Possible noise from the building itself (if central air)</li>
<li>Really troublesome to move in and out.</li>
<li>It takes minutes rather than seconds to leave the building. Add more time is driving your car out of that underground parking.</li>
<li>Mailboxes are small, and no one leaves your packages at your door. Because they can’t get to your door.</li>
<li>Setting off the smoke alarm might cause the entire building to evacuate.</li>
<li>No space for car washes.</li>
<li>Much higher likelihood of someone sniffing your packets and hacking your Wi-Fis.</li>
<li>Way more diseases.</li>
<li>No more sound of raindrops from the roof.</li>
</ol>

<li>A dude (whichever attack helicopter gender you choose to believe) is enraged by annoyance X. It is 2017, why do people still need to do X. It is bad for your health, it is bad for your mental state, it is bad for the environment. We need to do something about X.</li>
<li>Dude tells another Dude, also called Dude, about this problem. Dude agrees and is equally passionate about fixing the issue. New Business (Dude and Dude Co., DD) is created.</li>
<li>DD raises money from family and friends to solve X. In a month, dudes come up with a prototype that proves to future investors that the problem exists.</li>
<li>DD shows investors this problem they would like to solve.</li>
<li>DD gets the funding and solves the problem flawlessly. Business traction grows as word of mouth goes viral. “DD is a miracle,” say newspapers, blogs, youtube channels. “Just get DD,” “Top 10 tools to solve X in 2017.”</li>
<li>DD gets bought by Facebook.</li>
<li>Problem X comes back after DD.FB decide to monetise the hell out of the solution after crippling it for “new and improved enterprise pricing.”</li>
<li>Another dude is enraged by annoyance X. What the heck, it’s 2017. How is this still happening. The cycle repeats…</li>

<li><p>Then, <code>zipalign</code> the APK, which <a href="https://developer.android.com/studio/publish/app-signing.html" target="_blank" rel="external">reportedly</a> reduces the app’s memory usage:</p>

</li>
<li><p>Finally, sign your app with that keystore you just made.</p>

    	<p>There is a culture out there, that places immense emphasis on never failing. Where this culture predominates, failure is considered a permanent, irreversible loss of a thing called “面” (<em>min2</em>, lit. face), as well as one’s limited time left on Earth. Once you lose your face, you are said to have no face (“無面”, lit. no face). And without a face, you cannot face your parents (“對唔住”, lit. cannot face). However abstracted the words might have become over the years, their underlying meaning that <em>one must not fail</em> is deeply ingrained into the population’s minds.</p>
<p>Numerous people observe this culture. If you fail, not only does it shame you, it shames your entire family, ancestry, and/or surname. A failure on your part gives off a vibe that your parents did not raise you properly. Perhaps true, perhaps not. Nevertheless, because failure introduces such amount of shame, the people would go great lengths into ensuring things are completed successfully, no matter how competitive (for tests), harmful (for pulling all-nighters), or unethical (for polluting the environment).</p>
<p>And, of course, since everyone around you is going great lengths to avoid failure, you mirror their behaviours and also go great lengths to avoid failure. And not only do you conform to this behaviour, your parents, under great pressure not to be ashamed, also reinforce the standards you impose on yourself. <strong>It is a positive vicious cycle. You must not fail.</strong></p>
<p>The problem, however, cannot be solved simply with the power of shame. Suppose you are taking a test with 99 other people in this culture. Everyone is in the exam room, having studied weeks before, not pressured by success, but simply pressured by the possibility of shaming their parents. However well these 100 people do in this test, the distribution will still be bell-curved. Therefore, there will always be a percentage of people out there who are expected to put their families to shame. These people will then be called failures (“廢柴”, lit. useless firewood). People see these failures and call them as such. There is huge incentive for individuals and their families to hide these failures from others, so these failures are never seen. This is called (“衰俾人睇”, lit. fail for people to see).</p>
<p>Another way of looking at this, is that <a href="https://www.ted.com/playlists/152/what_is_success" target="_blank" rel="external">there is no such thing as work-life balance. You cannot have it all.</a> Therefore, if you succeed in one thing, you must have made some compromise by not succeeding in many other things. This has a strange, unrelated effect where people jump out of buildings a lot.</p>
<p>What happens if a society changes from “you should succeed” (“你要出人投地”, lit. you have to exit a man and throw the ground), to “you must not fail” (“唔好衰俾人睇”, lit. don’t fail for people to see)? For starters, fewer people think about success. Rarely do they stop and think about the future, thinking, <a href="http://www.schwarzenegger.com/" target="_blank" rel="external">“I want to be the world’s best bodybuilder,”</a> or “I want to make America great again”. Instead, the failure-averted often go to great lengths to ensure the odds for a predetermined event to be ever in their favour. Your parents loave your failures, rather than celebrate your successes.</p>
<p>Fool me once, shame on you; fool me twice, shame on me. This goes for failures in reverse: Fail your parents once, shame on you. Fail your parents twice, shame on them. If you fail your parents more than twice, they think you are failures. And because everyone statistically fails more than twice, <strong>all your parents think you are failures.</strong></p>
<p>You must not fail.</p>
