    	<p>With the amount of <a href="https://github.com/letsgetrandy/DICSS" target="_blank" rel="external">social justice</a> around the current world, who would be<br>the person around whose genotype, phenotype, and behaviour won’t oppress anyone?</p>
<p>The best place to find this answer is Tumblr, home of the Social Justice Warriors (SJW).</p>
<h1 id="Checklist"><a href="#Checklist" class="headerlink" title="Checklist"></a>Checklist</h1><h2 id="Your-wealth-1"><a href="#Your-wealth-1" class="headerlink" title="Your wealth (1)"></a>Your wealth (1)</h2><p>If you make more than minimum wage (less than thirty-thousand dollars per year),<br>you are automatically oppressing others.</p>
<p>Therefore, the ideal person would make $0, or, perhaps, borrow from the government.</p>
<h2 id="Your-kinship-2"><a href="#Your-kinship-2" class="headerlink" title="Your kinship (2)"></a>Your kinship (2)</h2><p>If you do not have a kinship, you are not one with Tumblr,= and are not eligible<br>for the title of the ideal person.</p>
<p>The ideal person would have at least one kinship other than being male or female.</p>
<h2 id="Country-of-residence-3"><a href="#Country-of-residence-3" class="headerlink" title="Country of residence (3)"></a>Country of residence (3)</h2><p>Live in North America, including Mexico? Well, you are a privileged bastard,<br>apparently. The ideal person must live somewhere such as the middle east, India,<br>or other places with lots of sand, such as Africa.</p>
<h2 id="Your-race-4"><a href="#Your-race-4" class="headerlink" title="Your race (4)"></a>Your race (4)</h2><p>If you are white (political “Caucasian”), all of your privileges are automatically<br>revoked, including the ones inherited from lands in which your <a href="http://theonus.tumblr.com/post/109903971710/draachen-idioticteen-harrystyls-what-is-white" target="_blank" rel="external">ethnicity</a><br>originates, because you are white.</p>
<p>The ideal person is probably as darkly skinned as possible.<br>This will probably offend someone out there, because not all people are humans,<br>and not all non-human being-kins are subject to skin colour.</p>
<h2 id="Your-face-5"><a href="#Your-face-5" class="headerlink" title="Your face (5)"></a>Your face (5)</h2><p>If you are a fit, healthy male, you are among the least likely to get the<br>attention from the Tumblr crowd. In fact, they seek individuals who are<br>unattractive, overweight, and (not or) with physical handicaps that are clearly<br>obvious, such as Down’s syndrome, or amputation.</p>
<h2 id="Your-gender-6"><a href="#Your-gender-6" class="headerlink" title="Your gender (6)"></a>Your gender (6)</h2><p>The ideal person would have a gender different from either male or female.<br>In fact, <a href="https://i.imgur.com/2ep3fub.jpg" target="_blank" rel="external">being male or female</a> is a silly notion that the people of Tumblr<br>wouldn not even consider being human. According to that screenshot, then, the<br>ideal person would either be a transgendered person, or whatever “genderfluid”<br>means in this context.</p>
<h2 id="Your-profession-7"><a href="#Your-profession-7" class="headerlink" title="Your profession (7)"></a>Your profession (7)</h2><p>Work anywhere? You are probably in trouble with Tumblr.<br>Being a teacher is a noble profession, of course, but God/Deity forbid if you<br>are male, because that would be taboo.</p>
<p>The ideal person can be anything if (anything but male), or nothing (if male).</p>
<h2 id="Disability-8"><a href="#Disability-8" class="headerlink" title="Disability (8)"></a>Disability (8)</h2><p>Are you disabled? Welcome aboard! You qualify for being the ideal person.<br>That is also to say: if you have all your limbs intact, this is not for you.</p>
<h2 id="Are-you-tall-9"><a href="#Are-you-tall-9" class="headerlink" title="Are you tall? (9)"></a>Are you tall? (9)</h2><p>If you are, you are a privileged misogynistic cis-male, regardless of whether<br>you apply to any of these accusations. Therefore, the ideal person can only be<br>short, with no identification possible on whether they (he/she/it) are human,<br>humanoid, or of other species.</p>
<h2 id="Your-sex-and-sexual-orientation-10"><a href="#Your-sex-and-sexual-orientation-10" class="headerlink" title="Your sex, and sexual orientation (10)"></a>Your sex, and sexual orientation (10)</h2><p>Not intersex? You are out.</p>
<p>Like a member of the opposite sex? HA! Sorry, you are out.<br>The only chances left for you are if you are bisexual, asexual, or are gay.<br>Being “traditional” is not a thing for the world’s most politically-correct<br>person out there.</p>
<h2 id="Religion-11"><a href="#Religion-11" class="headerlink" title="Religion (11)"></a>Religion (11)</h2><p>The religion that would get you the most points would be atheism.<br>Any other religion is actually fine, besides Christianity, because Christianity<br>is what Tumblr is actively attacking.</p>
<p>The ideal person is probably a Sikh.</p>
<h1 id="Are-you-oppressed"><a href="#Are-you-oppressed" class="headerlink" title="Are you oppressed?"></a>Are you oppressed?</h1><p>YES</p>
<h1 id="The-ideal-person"><a href="#The-ideal-person" class="headerlink" title="The ideal person"></a>The ideal person</h1><p>Given the checklist above, we can conclusively follow that the ideal person<br>(if at all a person), is, currently:</p>
<pre><code>A short (9) ugly (5) atheist (11)
  who is coloured (4) and missing a limb (8),
  poor (1) and unemployed (7) in Africa (3),
  ...
</code></pre><p>I am sure there are midget amputees out of Africa who are trapped in someone<br>else’s body, and we are here to ensure their social equality is not affected<br>by the <a href="https://github.com/letsgetrandy/DICSS/pull/16" target="_blank" rel="external">recent rise of patriarchy</a>.</p>
<p>Then comes the question: why are all <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=%22race+neutral+space%22" target="_blank" rel="external">spaces white</a>?<br>Why are there whitespaces, but no coloured spaces, animal-kin spaces, and<br>race/species-neutral spaces? Because of <a href="https://github.com/letsgetrandy/DICSS/pull/16" target="_blank" rel="external">white men</a>, that’s why.</p>

    	<p>(This is a summary of <a href="https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/the-freedom-change/201502/the-keys-rewarding-relationships-secure-attachment" target="_blank" rel="external">an article of the same name</a>.)</p>
<p>People with a “secure attachment style” can handle strong emotions and not be hijacked by them. About 55% of people grew up with it.</p>
<p>When parents are consistently available, warm, and responsive, (when the children get scared or distressed) the children develop secure attachment styles.</p>
<p>Soothing a child when distressed is called “up-regulating” the child’s emotions. For example, if you have ever seen a toddler fall and bang his or her knee; the first thing the child will typically do before crying is look at her mother or father’s face for a non-verbal signal as to how serious the injury is. It is as if the child is asking “What am I feeling?”</p>
<p>Because the child learns that he/she can feel scared or distressed, and then get comfort and be helped to feel better, they learn that negative emotions can be tolerated and managed effectively.  By extension, once they grow into adulthood, they don’t worry too much about other people leaving them or about getting hurt in relationships.</p>

    	<p>Ever had your friend proofread your thesis, and all you got for comments are things like “missing Oxford comma here” or “I think this word should be underlined”? As it turns out, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parkinson%27s_law_of_triviality" target="_blank" rel="external">there is a term for that: bikeshedding</a>!</p>
<p>Bikeshedding describes the amount of time people spend on trivial things versus the non-trivial. Naturally, one <em>ought to</em> spend more time on the non-trivial because they are more difficult to understand; however, because so many people know about the trivial, they argue, over and over, about them. About the unimportant.</p>
<p>Wikipedia has <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Avoid_Parkinson%27s_Bicycle_Shed_Effect" target="_blank" rel="external">its own meta article about its articles</a> warning its editors against arguing about the trivial.</p>
<p>Bikeshed.com, a domain dedicated to this phenomenon, contains a sweet quote:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“The really, really short answer is that you should not. The somewhat longer answer is that just because you are capable of building a bikeshed does not mean you should stop others from building one just because you do not like the color they plan to paint it. This is a metaphor indicating that you need not argue about every little feature just because you know enough to do so. Some people have commented that the amount of noise generated by a change is inversely proportional to the complexity of the change.” - <a href="http://bikeshed.com/" target="_blank" rel="external">bikeshed.com</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p><a href="http://meta.stackexchange.com/questions/31253/the-bikeshed-problem-and-stack-exchange" target="_blank" rel="external">Some people</a> argue that the trivial is not what the argument is about; many people believe that the argument is actually about game theory between the relative knowledge of the writer and the reader, while others think the ratio between trivial and non-trivial should strike a perfect balance to get the most out of a review.</p>
<p>To this day, I am still unsure how to tackle this problem at my workplace.</p>

    	<p>On Facebook, you can occasionally see blank avatars that look like a man with short hair, or avatars that look like <a href="https://www.facebook.com/pages/Default-female-FB-avatar-sorta-looks-like-Darth-Vader/192167327472723" target="_blank" rel="external">Darth Vader</a>.</p>
<p>As it turns out, the latter is Facebook’s idea of an anonymous female person. And that is, insofar as <a href="http://www.apa.org/pi/lgbt/resources/sexuality-definitions.pdf" target="_blank" rel="external">gender identity</a> is concerned, politically incorrect.</p>
<p>Just earlier today, I was schooled by a colleague of mine about my political incorrectness:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Gender is a spectrum, and many people don’t identify simply as “him” or “her”.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I thought they (my colleague, as a singular person/being, who appears to be male, but did not specifically identify in particular) had the right idea there, and I agree, perhaps catering for just 90% of anything is being ignorant. Being a start-up (startup?), why not go the extra mile to cater to those we care about?</p>
<p>While calling someone (or some <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Otherkin" target="_blank" rel="external">otherkin</a>?) <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ignorance" target="_blank" rel="external">ignorant</a> would be a serious accusation, the general idea would still stand. <a href="http://www.goodreads.com/quotes/tag/willful-ignorance" target="_blank" rel="external">The sole fact of you rejecting the notion that you are ignorant is being ignorant</a>, unless you also accept that (presumably facts) which are delivered to you, in which case, you are not ignorant, because you have taken in information from others.</p>
<p>A major problem with this mode of thinking is that <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Argument_from_ignorance#Basic_argument" target="_blank" rel="external">it is impossible to disprove your ignorance without being viewed as ignorant in the first place</a>. Then again, who cares, right? It’s not like anyone <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/tumblrinaction" target="_blank" rel="external">rejects to the thought of being open-minded</a>. You open your mind to everything others tell you, you become one of them, everybody wins.</p>
<h2 id="Never-refer-to-someone-as-“male”-or-“female”"><a href="#Never-refer-to-someone-as-“male”-or-“female”" class="headerlink" title="Never refer to someone as “male” or “female”"></a>Never refer to someone as “male” or “female”</h2><p>When you see someone (or some <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Otherkin" target="_blank" rel="external">otherkin</a>) on the streets, it is politically incorrect to assume that such as being is male or female. In fact, <a href="http://www.ndsu.edu/lgbtq/faq/" target="_blank" rel="external">many people and beings</a> refer to themselves as at least eight other types of identities:</p>
<ul>
<li>L: Lesbian</li>
<li>G: Gay</li>
<li>B: Bisexual</li>
<li>T: Transgender or Transsexual</li>
<li>Q: Queer or Questioning</li>
<li>I: Intersex (previously referred to as “hermaphrodite”, but Intersex is the more acceptable term to use now)</li>
<li>A: Asexual or Ally</li>
<li>2-S: Two Spirit (drawn from Native culture to refer to people who walk in two worlds – female and male)</li>
<li>(and many more; see <a href="http://www.ndsu.edu/lgbtq/faq/" target="_blank" rel="external">source</a>)</li>
</ul>
<p>While I am admittedly ignorant in that I have heard of, but never bothered, to learn about the “Ally” gender, or the difference between being two-spirit and intersex, I have learned today that I should at least never refer to anyone as just male or female, or either male or female, for that matter.</p>
<p>Much like you cannot call an African American person with that word they call each other, if someone self-identifies as male, that is <em>not</em> grounds for you (even if you identify as a male) to refer to such a person/being as “him”. This is your ignorance spewing out of your old-fashioned brain.</p>
<h2 id="Assume-all-terms-will-offend-unless-otherwise-given-permission"><a href="#Assume-all-terms-will-offend-unless-otherwise-given-permission" class="headerlink" title="Assume all terms will offend unless otherwise given permission"></a>Assume all terms will offend unless otherwise given permission</h2><p>Many people/beings care about what you don’t care about, and that does not make what they care about any less important than what you care about.</p>
<p>Just because, say, you self-identify as either male or female, and 90% of your friends and family self-identify as either male or female, it does not change the fact that there are many people/beings out there (10% of 6 billion [humans] is 600 million, right?) who self-identify as neither of these, regardless of their sex by birth. See: <a href="http://www.apa.org/pi/lgbt/resources/sexuality-definitions.pdf" target="_blank" rel="external">Sex, Gender, Gender Identity and Sexual Orientation</a>.</p>
<p>Such words and/or phrases you use to describe a person/being may offend them. These are called <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trauma_trigger" target="_blank" rel="external">triggers</a>; they put people/beings into a state of trauma.</p>
<p>As a result, if a person/being self-identifies to you as female, for example, it <em>should not</em> mean anything to you in understanding them (that person/being, a singular). The person/being self-identifies as female. That only gives that person/being the right to call themselves a female; it does not give you the right to call themselves a female.</p>
<p>Only when a person/being says,</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Please identify me as (one of the choices above), (your name),</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Should you be allowed to identify them as the choice specified.</p>
<h2 id="Never-be-offended"><a href="#Never-be-offended" class="headerlink" title="Never be offended"></a>Never be offended</h2><p>You need to play your part in this, of course! When someone says anything that upsets you, do not take it seriously. Instead, treat the offender with respect.</p>
<p>For example, if someone says you are disgusting and tells you to go fuc* yourself, don’t dwell on the fact that someone called you disgusting; focus on how you can improve yourself instead.</p>
<h2 id="Accommodate-the-minority-for-what-they-identify-to-be"><a href="#Accommodate-the-minority-for-what-they-identify-to-be" class="headerlink" title="Accommodate the minority for what they identify to be"></a>Accommodate the minority for what they identify to be</h2><p>No rule in (your country) sets forth the number of genders from which one may choose to identify; you can identify as any gender you want, including genders apart from the “popular” ones listed above.</p>
<p>Bear in mind that other people/beings can identify under a unique gender, as well.</p>
<p>Imagine a <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0149460/" target="_blank" rel="external">Futurama</a>-like world where a person/being you see on the streets can be a human, an alien, or a sewage dweller. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Mutants_Are_Revolting" target="_blank" rel="external">People/beings in that world respect each other</a>, communicate with each other as if they are the same kind. This is the world we are currently gearing towards, except there is no visual difference between each identifiable gender, unlike each species found in Futurama.</p>
<p>When a person/being claims to be a gay, please treat them like a normal person/being. Do note, “normal” changes quite a lot, so please keep up with the society for the correct way to deal with each situation.</p>
<h2 id="Have-fun"><a href="#Have-fun" class="headerlink" title="Have fun"></a>Have fun</h2><p>Gays, queers, bisexuals… they all enjoy the world like you do, and all deserve to live a life they ought them to be. If you are gender identity-agnostic, everyone/every being you meet are just like each other. So, have fun! Enjoy the world around you. There are a lot of genders to explore.</p>
