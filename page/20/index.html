    	<p>Suppose you are in your twenties to mid fourties, have some money to play with, and have no kids. (If you happen to be married, congratulations! <a href="http://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/dinks.asp" target="_blank" rel="external">The society wants your money and they want you dead</a>) What do you do with your money? Under heavy paternal influence, I spent some of it in the stock market.</p>
<h2 id="My-one-rule-have-money"><a href="#My-one-rule-have-money" class="headerlink" title="My one rule: have money"></a><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZzTV0G6wZJM" target="_blank" rel="external">My one rule</a>: have money</h2><p>This is Investment 001, the article aimed at people who have a pile of cash, don’t know what to do with it, and would rather buy a nice, 60-inch smart TV for the living room than putting the money to good use. (If you don’t have the money to invest with, what are you investing?)</p>
<h2 id="My-other-one-rule-know-what-you-are-doing"><a href="#My-other-one-rule-know-what-you-are-doing" class="headerlink" title="My other one rule: know what you are doing"></a>My other one rule: know what you are doing</h2><p>If there’s anything my mother taught me, it is that the key to anything is practice. As a mother, she knew how to do things, and do things right.</p>
<p>Here you are, on this blog, wondering how to get started; it has occurred to you that it is near impossible to just “get started”, or google “<a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=how+to+get+started+in+investing" target="_blank" rel="external">how to get started in investing</a>“ because the results are different for everyone. As a son of a mother, the first thing I learned to do was knowing what you are doing before doing what you will do.</p>
<h2 id="Which-one-should-I-buy-WOSIB"><a href="#Which-one-should-I-buy-WOSIB" class="headerlink" title="Which one should I buy (WOSIB)?"></a>Which one should I buy (WOSIB)?</h2><ul>
<li>If you have more than $10000000 to invest in, consider bribing your local government with lobbyists.</li>
<li>If you have more than $1000000 to invest in, consider buying a <em>house</em> near a freshwater lake.</li>
<li>If you have less than $100 to invest in, consider buying some weights and protein shakes from Wal-mart for mad gains.</li>
<li>If you have any other amount of money, consider buying <em>stocks, bonds, and mutual funds</em>.</li>
<li>If you don’t know how much you have, consider buying just mutual funds.</li>
</ul>
<p>A house, also known as <strong>property</strong> in this industry, are usually houses that you <em>don’t</em> live in. If you live in a house, it is called a <strong>liability</strong> (because you are in it, you cannot sell it, and as long as you are in it, it will only wear out.) <strong>Stocks</strong> are fractions of a company that you can buy. The moment you buy your first stock, you are a shareholder! A very small shareholder. <strong>Bonds</strong> are like stocks, but instead of companies, you buy the government’s debts. The government “borrows money from you”, agreeing to give you a bit more in return. <strong>Mutual funds</strong> are a mix of any of the above, managed by one or more <em>managers</em>, who typically know(s) better.</p>
<p>When you buy which depends on the state of the market. For example, if a recession is going on, stocks are likely dropping in prices, and you should be careful buying or selling them.</p>
<ul>
<li>Consider buying stocks in a <em>bull market</em>: a market where people are starting to gain confidence in investing.</li>
<li>Never buy stocks in a <em>bear market</em>: a market whose general prices are falling, and people are being pessimistic.</li>
<li>Consider buying mutual funds if you really don’t care, or some houses to rent out if you have a pile of money, <em>and</em> really don’t care.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="My-other-one-rule-don’t-lose-any-money"><a href="#My-other-one-rule-don’t-lose-any-money" class="headerlink" title="My other one rule: don’t lose any money"></a>My other one rule: don’t lose any money</h2><p>The first thing I learned about investing is that you shouldn’t be losing any money; this is invariably true. Anything your wife calls “investments”, such as that new dress or that new car, are not investments. They are not investments because they don’t earn you any money (unless you travel with that car to places where you earn money–and even then, this definition is debatable.) Not losing anything money is particularly hard when inflation is factored in, where <em>not investing</em> is a net loss of 3% per month. Therefore, the key to success in investing is to figure out how not to lose any money – a story for another day.</p>

    	<p><a href="http://nigelsmall.com/" target="_blank" rel="external">Py2neo</a> sucks.</p>
<p>There, I said it. Py2neo sucks. It is an undocumented piece of work that no one can work with.</p>
<p>I am working with Py2neo 1.8.4 (which is currently the default version on PyPI, by the way), and its documentation is next to useless.</p>
<p>Here was an example piece of code I wrote (tutorial <a href="http://book.py2neo.org/en/latest/indexes/" target="_blank" rel="external">here</a>):</p>
<figure class="highlight capnproto"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre><span class="line">1</span><br><span class="line">2</span><br></pre></td><td class="code"><pre><span class="line"><span class="keyword">from</span> py2neo <span class="keyword">import</span> neo4j</span><br><span class="line">graph = neo4j.Graph()</span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure>
<p>And <code>Graph</code> apparently didn’t exist, because it is called <code>GraphDatabaseService</code> now. Thanks for telling me!</p>
<p>Alright, now that we have a working <code>graph</code> object, we can call methods on the graph object to manipulate the database.</p>
<figure class="highlight ruby"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre><span class="line">1</span><br><span class="line">2</span><br><span class="line">3</span><br><span class="line">4</span><br></pre></td><td class="code"><pre><span class="line">ref_node = graph.get_reference_node()  <span class="comment"># right from the tutorial</span></span><br><span class="line"></span><br><span class="line"><span class="meta">&gt;&gt;</span>&gt; graph.get_reference_node()  <span class="comment"># me doing the same thing</span></span><br><span class="line"><span class="symbol">AttributeError:</span> <span class="string">'GraphDatabaseService'</span> object has no attribute <span class="string">'get_reference_node'</span></span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure>
<p>Bam! The <code>graph</code> object is not as described – what happened? Well, according to <a href="https://github.com/nigelsmall/py2neo/commit/9ee8b89989ed92776aba6fb965d2cc46521e720b" target="_blank" rel="external">Github</a>, that method was removed around two years ago. Thanks for telling me about that too!</p>
<p>Before we jump to conclusions, perhaps we need a third example to make a point. What about methods that still exist in the codebase today? Take <a href="http://book.py2neo.org/en/latest/graphs_nodes_relationships/#py2neo.neo4j.GraphDatabaseService.get_indexes" target="_blank" rel="external"><code>get_indexes</code></a>, for example:</p>
<figure class="highlight python"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre><span class="line">1</span><br><span class="line">2</span><br><span class="line">3</span><br><span class="line">4</span><br><span class="line">5</span><br></pre></td><td class="code"><pre><span class="line"><span class="function"><span class="keyword">def</span> <span class="title">get_indexes</span><span class="params">(...)</span>:</span></span><br><span class="line">    <span class="string">"""</span></span><br><span class="line"><span class="string">        :param content_type: either :py:class:`neo4j.Node` or</span></span><br><span class="line"><span class="string">            :py:class:`neo4j.Relationship`"""</span></span><br><span class="line">    <span class="comment"># (...)</span></span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure>
<p>Sure, <code>get_indexes</code> accepts either a <code>Node</code> or a <code>Relationship</code>. Let’s call it with a <code>Node</code>.</p>
<figure class="highlight crmsh"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre><span class="line">1</span><br><span class="line">2</span><br></pre></td><td class="code"><pre><span class="line">&gt;&gt;&gt; graph_db.get_indexes(graph_db.node(<span class="number">1</span>))</span><br><span class="line">IndexTypeError: <span class="keyword">Node</span><span class="title"></span></span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure>
<p>Why don’t I give it a fourth example?</p>
<figure class="highlight ruby"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre><span class="line">1</span><br><span class="line">2</span><br><span class="line">3</span><br></pre></td><td class="code"><pre><span class="line"><span class="function"><span class="keyword">def</span> <span class="title">get_indexed_node</span><span class="params">(index_name, key, value)</span></span>: <span class="comment"># that's what it says, in the docs</span></span><br><span class="line"><span class="meta">&gt;&gt;</span>&gt; self.graph.get_indexed_relationship(indexed_name=<span class="string">""</span>, key=<span class="string">""</span>, value=<span class="string">""</span>)</span><br><span class="line"><span class="symbol">TypeError:</span> get_indexed_relationship() got an unexpected keyword argument <span class="string">'indexed_name'</span></span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure>

    	<p>With <a href="http://www.technobuffalo.com/2014/08/03/android-overtakes-ios-in-usage-stats-for-the-first-time-ever/" target="_blank" rel="external">Android being all the hype these days</a>, I have decided to make an app.</p>
<p>Having abandoned Java since 2010 (excluding that one bug fix in one of the company’s repositories in 2014), I really had nothing to lose. The syntax, the types, the way projects are built, event handling… I have forgotten all that. This app will be a fresh start to programming something again – something that isn’t run in the browser.</p>
<h2 id="Downloading-the-SDK"><a href="#Downloading-the-SDK" class="headerlink" title="Downloading the SDK"></a>Downloading the SDK</h2><p>Have you used eclipse? Of course you have. But do you <em>like</em> Eclipse? That’s a much less certain question to answer. </p>
<p>It was actually <a href="https://developer.android.com/sdk/installing/studio.html" target="_blank" rel="external">JetBrains’ release of the first usable SDK</a> that had my interest. When version 0.8 was released, all the screenshots looked like it looked like PyCharm, which is what I use for work and personal projects already. Presumably, with Android Studio, I would be able to add code, edit interfaces, and code like a normal human being, right…?</p>
<p>That is correct!</p>
<p>Unlike Eclipse, the <em>de facto</em> Java IDE from the <a href="https://www.eclipse.org/org/foundation/contact.php" target="_blank" rel="external">software giant of Ottawa</a>, JetBrains products are not complete and utter shit; instead, they are designed to get out of the way of the developer. Hell, I don’t even know how to change the editor’s background from white to black in Eclipse.</p>
<h2 id="Creating-a-new-project"><a href="#Creating-a-new-project" class="headerlink" title="Creating a new project"></a>Creating a new project</h2><p>Creating a new project is easy enough. Android Studio has a nice wizard that guides you through the process. The wizard creates a project, an <a href="http://developer.android.com/reference/android/app/Activity.html" target="_blank" rel="external">activity</a>, and a <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/6811989/android-switching-screens-with-new-activity-or-just-changing-content-view" target="_blank" rel="external">layout / “content view”</a> inside that activity (which is some kind of abstraction… see later posts.)</p>
<h2 id="Creating-the-UI"><a href="#Creating-the-UI" class="headerlink" title="Creating the UI"></a>Creating the UI</h2><p>I remember from the Visual Basic 6 days that UIs were extremely easy to make and configure. For instance, if you wanted a number box with a default value, min and max, you would drag one of such element into the window (“form”), enter these values on the right hand <em>Properties</em> pane, and call it a day.</p>
<p>In Android, it is different. To be precise, there is no such thing as doing something intuitively in Java/Android. Here is why:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/12317960" target="_blank" rel="external">It is impossible to set min and max from the layout xml</a>.</li>
<li><a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/20968561/android-numberpicker-negative-values" target="_blank" rel="external">It is impossible to set a negative value on a NumberPicker</a>. You can only subtract the value by a negative number after the fact, e.g.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="Finishing-the-Project"><a href="#Finishing-the-Project" class="headerlink" title="Finishing the Project"></a>Finishing the Project</h2><p>The rest of the build process is very streamlined, however! Android Studio itself includes a way to build a release APK right from its menu. My first app wasn’t qualified for Google Play Store (because it didn’t have a custom icon), but at least the APK was valid and functional.</p>
<p>More to come!</p>

<p>Heard from someone I know (but wish not to disclose his/her identity) that Hexo is a nice framework to use for generating a static blog. Having never done that before, I thought, what the hell!</p>
<p>My experience with Hexo has been very pleasant (or… much better than my previous encounters with node and npm). Here are a few take-aways:</p>
<ul>
<li>Incorrect permissions of the local npm cache (caused by <code>sudo</code>) <em>can</em> and <em>will</em> fail most of the npm- and nodejs-related tasks that you will be running.</li>
<li>Inserting images in Hexo (apparently <code>/source</code> is the root path, not <code>/</code> as the config suggests)</li>
<li><a href="https://www.npmjs.org/package/hexo-livereload" target="_blank" rel="external"><code>livereload</code></a> requires <a href="http://feedback.livereload.com/knowledgebase/articles/86242-how-do-i-install-and-use-the-browser-extensions-" target="_blank" rel="external">a browser plugin</a>.</li>
<li>You need to <em>click</em> on livereload’s button in the browser…</li>
<li>EJS, because <a href="https://github.com/joyceim/hexo-theme-apollo" target="_blank" rel="external">the theme</a> uses it</li>
<li>Stylus, because that’s also what the theme requires; it allows semicolons and brackets to be omitted anywhere you want!</li>
<li>Apparently <a href="http://code.tutsplus.com/tutorials/sass-vs-less-vs-stylus-preprocessor-shootout--net-24320" target="_blank" rel="external">SASS is deprecating its bracket-free syntax</a></li>
<li>How to <a href="http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/syntax" target="_blank" rel="external">create referenced links</a>.</li>
<li>How to <a href="http://hexo.io/docs/deployment.html" target="_blank" rel="external">deploy this blog</a>. Booboo! You don’t commit and push – you deploy and push to a draft branch.</li>
<li><a href="http://blog.lazywei.com/2013/11/24/how-do-i-configure-my-hexo-blog/" target="_blank" rel="external">Deploying blogs to github under a custom domain.</a></li>
</ul>
<p>It has been an amazing learning experience! I’m taking a lot of notes as I go. More to come tomorrow.</p>

    	<p>I had a tight schedule yesterday, because I had to go to the train station right after church, so that I can catch a train to downtown Toronto. This is my first time going downtown alone, so I needed a lot of help.</p>
<p>Surrogate helped search for the correct train route to get to Union Station (the main station). While I was waiting for the train, I started a conversation with a cyclist called Michael, a young (25ish?) white male, who was also waiting for the train. He was wrapped in spandex and had a good racing bike. we talked on the train, about life (“I was born in Nova Scotia” “Same here”) and death (“The people where I came from have no place to get themselves buried” “wow”) and everything in between (“The Canadian dollar is dropping like-“ “I know”), all the way until we got to Union station.</p>
<p>We didn’t exchange numbers because I don’t think there’s anything to do even IF we meet again. What, meet up for tea or something? I thanked him for his help around the station, and we went our own ways.</p>
<p>I got to That Guy’s place (University of Toronto) by the transit system (“TTC”). His campus wasn’t big, but is entirely accessible by car. Waterloo’s academic buildings are rarely accessible by cars - and there are tons of parking spaces for that reason.</p>
<p>The other guy from McMaster and another man from Waterloo were at That Guy’s dorm as well, because they came over for thanksgiving too. We four went out the whole day and bought bubble tea. Considering the non-locality of this speciality, the bubble tea was actually pretty good.</p>
<p>The Asiatown here is massive. At least it’s massive compared to what we have in Waterloo (“there is none”). We walked around Chinatown, went to Eaton Center (the big shopping mall everyone makes a big deal about) and froze all the computers in the newly open Apple store, all thanks to another man from Waterloo, the mac expert.</p>
<p>We went to a book store there and read mini books which they sell. Looking at these books, I might consider making mini books again…. they have market. Apparently.</p>
<p>We walked for 9 hours in total, covering the day from 12pm to 10pm. We had dinner at an empty pizza shop because everywhere else was packed. We had an idea why the shop was empty - the cashier doesn’t have good attitude. Beggars asking us for food too, and we gave him excess onion rings. We could have given him more garlic bread but we forgot.</p>
<p>There are 6000 homeless people in this town, but nobody really cares… </p>
