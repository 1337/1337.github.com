    	<p>Startups (start-ups) are hard.</p>
<p>You are the CEO of <em>QuickHolland</em>, a company that sells instant hollandaise sauce (currently in R&amp;D) in revolutionary, squeeze-bottle form factor.</p>
<p>As a founder in a startup, you likely have several priorities to juggle:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Maintaining your vision</strong>, because it is <em>your</em> company</li>
<li><strong>Maintaining investor relations</strong>, to get advice from them (if they are on the board) or to have a constant source of funding</li>
<li><strong>Managing your day-to-day business</strong>, because, again, this company is yours to run.</li>
</ol>
<p>This post explains why it is often difficult to do all of these things.</p>
<h2 id="1-Maintaining-your-vision"><a href="#1-Maintaining-your-vision" class="headerlink" title="1. Maintaining your vision"></a>1. Maintaining your vision</h2><p>Your mother just spent an hour <a href="http://ciaoegrazie.wordpress.com/tag/gordon-ramsays-hollandaise-sauce/" target="_blank" rel="external">making hollandaise sauce from scratch</a>, and she complains to you that it was too time-consuming a thing to do in the morning–when people need to get to work on time.</p>
<p>You have an idea; a lightbulb glowed atop your head. Instant hollandaise sauce. You narrow your vision. You set your goal. You incorporate your company. And you hire on the best people you know.</p>
<p>Now what?</p>
<p><strong>Is it your job to stick to the vision, or is it sometimes appropriate to modify the company’s vision?</strong></p>
<p>One year into your saucy enterprise, you find yourself in a sticky situation, where your food scientists come up with something in a squeeze bottle, but no one is buying it. “But build it and they will come,” you think to yourself, “maybe I am not reaching the correct market.”</p>
<p>You pitch your idea to your investors and they say that your idea reeks of unoriginality. They say that it has been done before. “Is this like other hollandaise sauces out there, except <del>on social networks</del>in a squeeze bottle?” You tell them yes, but, see, the squeeze bottle is what we’re <em>really</em> selling. Your investors, agreeing with your explanation, throw money at you for another year of runway.</p>
<p><strong>Are you now selling hollandaise sauce, or are you now selling squeeze bottles?</strong></p>
<p>You go back to your team of scientists and tell them you have decided to <em>pivot</em>. To pivot is to change the direction of the company–your corporate vision has now changed. Half of your team leaves your company because they are food scientists, not petroleum engineers (who would be the people who commonly make squeeze bottles). “No matter,” you think to yourself, “I have <em>leads</em>.”</p>
<h2 id="2-Maintaining-investor-relations"><a href="#2-Maintaining-investor-relations" class="headerlink" title="2. Maintaining investor relations"></a>2. Maintaining investor relations</h2><p>You own 100% of the company, but you need some initial funding, so the first course of action, of course, is to ask family and friends for your “bootstrap” money. That money buys you time, the ability to pay lawyers and governments for business-related fees, and money to hire your first employee.</p>
<p>Of course, you will almost certainly want to hire more than one employee, so you sell your company’s <em>shares</em>, to your investors (wherever you got hold of them to begin with), for instant funding, paid back by them as <em>convertible notes</em>. With that capital, you hire your second, third, fourth employees, and so on. You know how long your <em>runway</em> is (how much money you have {div} how much money you spend per month), and so do your investors, because they request that kind of information. They give you funding because they know you have a team who can execute your idea. They give you funding because you seem like a competent leader. They give you funding because, ultimately, your company might succeed, which means more money for them.</p>
<p><strong>What if you don’t succeed?</strong></p>
<h2 id="3-Managing-your-day-to-day-business"><a href="#3-Managing-your-day-to-day-business" class="headerlink" title="3. Managing your day-to-day business"></a>3. Managing your day-to-day business</h2><p><em>QuickHolland</em> is your first business, and it is your baby. By now, you have been working on it for three years, and you have pivoted three times so far; your company now prints posters for supermarkets that sell your brilliant squeeze bottles, turning your company into an advertising agency. You still have your brilliant team of people, but only one food scientist is left at this point, because the company isn’t really making food anymore.</p>
<p>On your fourth year, you run out of funding (which is a surprising amount of time, because investors gave you only one year’s worth of money.) You cannot pay your employees for the time being, but, no matter, this too shall pass. You try very hard to look for new investors. You get about half a year worth of runway, yet again, saving the company once more.</p>
<p><strong>Are you going to pay your employees their unsettled wages? If so, how?</strong></p>
<p>Once, while swimming in Salt Lake, you encounter a young, attractive woman, who happens to be interested in you. You two share the same interests, same backgrounds, and quickly fall in love. Once she moves in, You quickly realise that you no longer have the time and patience to run and maintain the company that was once your baby and vision. Hell, it isn’t even what your mother asked for anymore.</p>
<p><strong>What comes first? Your life, or your company?</strong></p>

    	<p><strong>CoffeeScript is superior to JavaScript and you know it.</strong></p>
<p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jeremy_Ashkenas" target="_blank" rel="external">Jeremy Ashkenas</a> brought <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CoffeeScript" target="_blank" rel="external">CoffeeScript</a> into this World to eliminate quirks in JavaScript, such as fuzzy comparison (amateur usages of the <code>==</code> operator) and <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/444080/do-you-recommend-using-semicolons-after-every-statement-in-javascript" target="_blank" rel="external">optional semicolons</a>, which is very confusing for beginner JavaScript developers like you and me. Naturally, Mr. Ashkenas came up with a neat programming construct that helps the problem by introducing syntax that is simpler, more convenient, and clearer to read.</p>
<h2 id="Rationale"><a href="#Rationale" class="headerlink" title="Rationale"></a>Rationale</h2><p>Suppose you have an array</p>
<figure class="highlight lsl"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre><span class="line">1</span><br></pre></td><td class="code"><pre><span class="line">array = [<span class="number">1</span>, <span class="number">2</span>, <span class="number">3</span>, <span class="number">4</span>, <span class="number">5</span>]  # this is also [<span class="number">1.</span><span class="number">.5</span>], by the way! go CoffeeScript!</span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure>
<p>You can write the same array <em>without</em> the commas that CoffeeScript hates.</p>
<figure class="highlight lsl"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre><span class="line">1</span><br><span class="line">2</span><br><span class="line">3</span><br><span class="line">4</span><br><span class="line">5</span><br><span class="line">6</span><br><span class="line">7</span><br></pre></td><td class="code"><pre><span class="line">array = [  # now this is a CoffeeScript array</span><br><span class="line">    <span class="number">1</span></span><br><span class="line">    <span class="number">2</span></span><br><span class="line">    <span class="number">3</span></span><br><span class="line">    <span class="number">4</span></span><br><span class="line">    <span class="number">5</span></span><br><span class="line">]</span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure>
<p>Why stop there, we can have objects without commas:</p>
<figure class="highlight dts"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre><span class="line">1</span><br><span class="line">2</span><br><span class="line">3</span><br><span class="line">4</span><br><span class="line">5</span><br><span class="line">6</span><br><span class="line">7</span><br></pre></td><td class="code"><pre><span class="line">obj = &#123;</span><br><span class="line"><span class="symbol">    a:</span> <span class="number">1</span></span><br><span class="line"><span class="symbol">    b:</span> <span class="number">2</span></span><br><span class="line"><span class="symbol">    c:</span> <span class="number">3</span></span><br><span class="line"><span class="symbol">    d:</span> <span class="number">4</span></span><br><span class="line"><span class="symbol">    e:</span> <span class="number">5</span></span><br><span class="line">&#125;</span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure>
<p>, which is no surprise. However, did you know:</p>
<figure class="highlight makefile"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre><span class="line">1</span><br><span class="line">2</span><br><span class="line">3</span><br><span class="line">4</span><br><span class="line">5</span><br><span class="line">6</span><br><span class="line">7</span><br></pre></td><td class="code"><pre><span class="line">obj = &#123;  <span class="comment"># not a SyntaxError</span></span><br><span class="line">    a</span><br><span class="line">    b</span><br><span class="line">    c</span><br><span class="line">    d</span><br><span class="line">    e</span><br><span class="line">&#125;</span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure>
<p>and</p>
<figure class="highlight makefile"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre><span class="line">1</span><br><span class="line">2</span><br><span class="line">3</span><br></pre></td><td class="code"><pre><span class="line">obj = &#123;a, b, c, d, e&#125;  <span class="comment"># not a SyntaxError AND not a set!</span></span><br><span class="line"></span><br><span class="line">obj = &#123;a b c d e&#125;  <span class="comment"># not a thing</span></span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure>
<p>Why stop there, we can remove the braces too, because who likes typing braces if you don’t have to?</p>
<figure class="highlight dts"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre><span class="line">1</span><br><span class="line">2</span><br><span class="line">3</span><br><span class="line">4</span><br><span class="line">5</span><br><span class="line">6</span><br></pre></td><td class="code"><pre><span class="line">obj =</span><br><span class="line"><span class="symbol">    a:</span> <span class="number">1</span></span><br><span class="line"><span class="symbol">    b:</span> <span class="number">2</span></span><br><span class="line"><span class="symbol">    c:</span> <span class="number">3</span></span><br><span class="line"><span class="symbol">    d:</span> <span class="number">4</span></span><br><span class="line"><span class="symbol">    e:</span> <span class="number">5</span></span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure>
<p>It’s all well and good until this one turned up</p>
<figure class="highlight makefile"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre><span class="line">1</span><br><span class="line">2</span><br><span class="line">3</span><br><span class="line">4</span><br><span class="line">5</span><br><span class="line">6</span><br></pre></td><td class="code"><pre><span class="line">obj =  <span class="comment"># unexpectedly, you can't omit things whenever you want</span></span><br><span class="line">    a</span><br><span class="line">    b</span><br><span class="line">    c</span><br><span class="line">    d</span><br><span class="line">    e</span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure>
<p>And that is what makes CoffeeScript better for iterative development.</p>
<h2 id="Exercises"><a href="#Exercises" class="headerlink" title="Exercises"></a>Exercises</h2><h3 id="Exercise-1"><a href="#Exercise-1" class="headerlink" title="Exercise 1"></a>Exercise 1</h3><p>What is <code>result</code> for each of these three statements in CoffeeScript?</p>

    	<p>I don’t actually know much about JavaScript development when it comes to npm, grunt, gulp, and volo. They all seemed like… things, to me. Do you have a webapp that handles your models, controllers, and views, but somehow you need static files to be generated using these new workflows, but have no idea how? That’s what I am going through! Here outlines my learnings.</p>
<h1 id="Always-specify-your-path"><a href="#Always-specify-your-path" class="headerlink" title="Always specify your path"></a>Always specify your path</h1><p>Before you do anything in your project, tell <code>npm</code> where to put your packages. This is done by running:</p>
<figure class="highlight routeros"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre><span class="line">1</span><br></pre></td><td class="code"><pre><span class="line"><span class="builtin-name">export</span> <span class="attribute">PATH</span>=node_modules/.bin:$&#123;PATH&#125;</span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure>
<p>Alternatively, investigate in some sort of <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/3653495/is-there-an-virtual-environment-for-node-js" target="_blank" rel="external">virtualenv</a>. If they worked the way Python’s virtualenv did, then it would be the way to go, but I have no success with them.</p>
<h1 id="Tell-npm-to-install-bower-components"><a href="#Tell-npm-to-install-bower-components" class="headerlink" title="Tell npm to install bower components"></a>Tell npm to install bower components</h1><p>The typical workflow consists of the following:</p>
<figure class="highlight cmake"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre><span class="line">1</span><br><span class="line">2</span><br></pre></td><td class="code"><pre><span class="line">npm <span class="keyword">install</span></span><br><span class="line">bowser <span class="keyword">install</span></span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure>
<p>Don’t you think, why run the second command manually if <code>npm</code> could run it for me? That would be correct – this simple configuration in <code>package.json</code> will do the trick.</p>
<figure class="highlight json"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre><span class="line">1</span><br><span class="line">2</span><br><span class="line">3</span><br><span class="line">4</span><br><span class="line">5</span><br></pre></td><td class="code"><pre><span class="line">&#123;</span><br><span class="line">  <span class="attr">"scripts"</span>: &#123;</span><br><span class="line">    <span class="attr">"postinstall"</span>: <span class="string">"bower install"</span></span><br><span class="line">  &#125;</span><br><span class="line">&#125;</span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure>
<h1 id="Install-almost-everything-with-save"><a href="#Install-almost-everything-with-save" class="headerlink" title="Install (almost) everything with --save"></a>Install (almost) everything with <code>--save</code></h1><p>Unlike <code>apt-get</code>, nothing you save with <code>npm</code> and <code>bower</code> will be available to your environment by default. To persist these packages across multiple developer machines, run <code>npm install</code> and <code>bower install</code> with the <code>--save</code> flag, which records the packages you installed into <code>package.json</code> and <code>bower.json</code>, respectively.</p>
<h1 id="Always-do-the-hippest-thing"><a href="#Always-do-the-hippest-thing" class="headerlink" title="Always do the hippest thing"></a>Always do the hippest thing</h1><p>Java has a reputation for having robust, tried-and-true methods for doing everything. Want to run a webapp? Install spring’s jars. Want to install a package? You will probably be using maven. However, in JavaScript development, everything is making a new flavour of everything, where no standard is made and/or obeyed. Ignoring the fact that no one has any idea what is going on, it is also apparent that the only way to stay afloat in the web development community is to use the most recent builds of everything, in order to shorten your dependency tree (example: if you need to use an older version of Backbone, then all other dependencies will install newer versions of Backbone alongside yours).</p>
<p>Never settle for Grunt, because Gulp exists. If Gulp has a newer alternative, then switch to it immediately. There is no such thing as resilience in this field – the only thing you need to do is to accept change.</p>

<p>I am a contributor of <a href="https://github.com/snipe/downworthy" target="_blank" rel="external">Downworthy</a>, a Chrome extension that removes annoying words from online headings and bodies, sometimes known as <a href="http://www.lunametrics.com/website-traffic/seo/link-bait/" target="_blank" rel="external">linkbaits or clickbaits</a>. Since it is disappointing to click on an interesting-sounding link, for example:</p>
<blockquote>
<h1 id="How-I-earned-a-million-dollars-overnight"><a href="#How-I-earned-a-million-dollars-overnight" class="headerlink" title="How I earned a million dollars overnight"></a>How I earned a million dollars overnight</h1></blockquote>
<p>Just to be followed by a slow page, <a href="http://motherfuckingwebsite.com/" target="_blank" rel="external">megabytes of useless JavaScript and images</a>, and a <em>ton</em> of ads:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I bought the lottery and won. Here are five paragraphs about the process, how much I spent on the ticket, how I felt, and how it affects you and me. EXCLUSIVE: 35 SHOCKING SELFIES I TOOK WHEN I COLLECTED MAH MONEY</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Naturally, to avoid future incidences of clicking on these mid-grade links, we must first analyse the components of a linkbait title, and how we can neutralise such titles so that normal titles, which may well contain more interesting stories, can get their fair share of our clicks.</p>
<h2 id="Anatomy-of-a-stupid-linkbait-title"><a href="#Anatomy-of-a-stupid-linkbait-title" class="headerlink" title="Anatomy of a stupid linkbait title"></a>Anatomy of a <del>stupid</del> linkbait title</h2><p>Let’s first look at the front page of <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/funny/comments/2cwi1l/it_hasnt_even_been_a_day/" target="_blank" rel="external">Buzzfeed</a>, one of the most pathetic websites on the planet.</p>
<p><img src="image/1203.png" alt="-"></p>
<p>You will find their titles fit in one or more of these three categories.</p>
<p><strong>Lists</strong>, particularly lists that somehow you can relate:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>17</strong> Things To Do When You Are Bored Out Of Your Mind</li>
<li><strong>5</strong> Brilliant BuzzFeed Newsletters That Will Always Brighten Your Day</li>
<li><strong>19</strong> Superfood Combinations That Will Make You Feel Like A Champion</li>
<li><strong>21</strong> Embarrassing Things Every Muggle Secretly Does</li>
<li><strong>19</strong> Signs You’re Definitely Eric Forman From “That ’70s Show”</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Titles beginning with Who/What/When/Where/Why</strong>, whether or not they are actual questions:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>What</strong> Type Of Shark Are You?</li>
<li><strong>Which</strong> Sci-Fi Hero Should You Hook Up With?</li>
<li><strong>How</strong> One Company Is Building An Internet Connection Through The Arctic Thanks To Climate Change</li>
<li><strong>What</strong> It’s Like To Go Blind</li>
<li><strong>What</strong> The World Was Like In 1974 When Richard Nixon Resigned</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Exaggeration</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>This Fact About Killer Whales <strong>Will Blow Your Mind</strong></li>
<li>The <strong>Most Fab And Drab</strong> Celebrity Outfits Of The Week</li>
<li>24 Pictures That Prove That Life Hacks Have <strong>Gone Way Too Far</strong></li>
<li>This Timelapse Video Of Pyongyang, North Korea Is <strong>Beautiful And Intriguing</strong> (it wasn’t)</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Reading comprehension</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.scribblrs.com/science-behind-buzzfeeds-viral-articles/" target="_blank" rel="external">Most viral articles by Buzzfeed have vocabulary aimed at 10-year-olds</a>.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="Takeaways"><a href="#Takeaways" class="headerlink" title="Takeaways"></a>Takeaways</h2><p>There are only two things we have learned from this exercise:</p>
<ul>
<li>Annoying titles overpromise</li>
<li>Annoying articles underdeliver</li>
</ul>
<p>To avoid wasting time on these posts (including this one, for some), I suggest installing the <a href="https://github.com/snipe/downworthy" target="_blank" rel="external">downworthy</a> plugin!</p>

    	<p>Suppose you are in your twenties to mid fourties, have some money to play with, and have no kids. (If you happen to be married, congratulations! <a href="http://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/dinks.asp" target="_blank" rel="external">The society wants your money and they want you dead</a>) What do you do with your money? Under heavy paternal influence, I spent some of it in the stock market.</p>
<h2 id="My-one-rule-have-money"><a href="#My-one-rule-have-money" class="headerlink" title="My one rule: have money"></a><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZzTV0G6wZJM" target="_blank" rel="external">My one rule</a>: have money</h2><p>This is Investment 001, the article aimed at people who have a pile of cash, don’t know what to do with it, and would rather buy a nice, 60-inch smart TV for the living room than putting the money to good use. (If you don’t have the money to invest with, what are you investing?)</p>
<h2 id="My-other-one-rule-know-what-you-are-doing"><a href="#My-other-one-rule-know-what-you-are-doing" class="headerlink" title="My other one rule: know what you are doing"></a>My other one rule: know what you are doing</h2><p>If there’s anything my mother taught me, it is that the key to anything is practice. As a mother, she knew how to do things, and do things right.</p>
<p>Here you are, on this blog, wondering how to get started; it has occurred to you that it is near impossible to just “get started”, or google “<a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=how+to+get+started+in+investing" target="_blank" rel="external">how to get started in investing</a>“ because the results are different for everyone. As a son of a mother, the first thing I learned to do was knowing what you are doing before doing what you will do.</p>
<h2 id="Which-one-should-I-buy-WOSIB"><a href="#Which-one-should-I-buy-WOSIB" class="headerlink" title="Which one should I buy (WOSIB)?"></a>Which one should I buy (WOSIB)?</h2><ul>
<li>If you have more than $10000000 to invest in, consider bribing your local government with lobbyists.</li>
<li>If you have more than $1000000 to invest in, consider buying a <em>house</em> near a freshwater lake.</li>
<li>If you have less than $100 to invest in, consider buying some weights and protein shakes from Wal-mart for mad gains.</li>
<li>If you have any other amount of money, consider buying <em>stocks, bonds, and mutual funds</em>.</li>
<li>If you don’t know how much you have, consider buying just mutual funds.</li>
</ul>
<p>A house, also known as <strong>property</strong> in this industry, are usually houses that you <em>don’t</em> live in. If you live in a house, it is called a <strong>liability</strong> (because you are in it, you cannot sell it, and as long as you are in it, it will only wear out.) <strong>Stocks</strong> are fractions of a company that you can buy. The moment you buy your first stock, you are a shareholder! A very small shareholder. <strong>Bonds</strong> are like stocks, but instead of companies, you buy the government’s debts. The government “borrows money from you”, agreeing to give you a bit more in return. <strong>Mutual funds</strong> are a mix of any of the above, managed by one or more <em>managers</em>, who typically know(s) better.</p>
<p>When you buy which depends on the state of the market. For example, if a recession is going on, stocks are likely dropping in prices, and you should be careful buying or selling them.</p>
<ul>
<li>Consider buying stocks in a <em>bull market</em>: a market where people are starting to gain confidence in investing.</li>
<li>Never buy stocks in a <em>bear market</em>: a market whose general prices are falling, and people are being pessimistic.</li>
<li>Consider buying mutual funds if you really don’t care, or some houses to rent out if you have a pile of money, <em>and</em> really don’t care.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="My-other-one-rule-don’t-lose-any-money"><a href="#My-other-one-rule-don’t-lose-any-money" class="headerlink" title="My other one rule: don’t lose any money"></a>My other one rule: don’t lose any money</h2><p>The first thing I learned about investing is that you shouldn’t be losing any money; this is invariably true. Anything your wife calls “investments”, such as that new dress or that new car, are not investments. They are not investments because they don’t earn you any money (unless you travel with that car to places where you earn money–and even then, this definition is debatable.) Not losing anything money is particularly hard when inflation is factored in, where <em>not investing</em> is a net loss of 3% per month. Therefore, the key to success in investing is to figure out how not to lose any money – a story for another day.</p>
<h2 id="Disclaimer"><a href="#Disclaimer" class="headerlink" title="Disclaimer"></a>Disclaimer</h2><p>I am just someone you read about on the Internet. Do not believe in everything I say. Make your own decisions.</p>
