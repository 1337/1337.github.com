    	<p>For <em>absolutely no reason whatsoever</em>, I got myself a holiday to <a href="https://www.google.com/maps/place/Tobermory,+ON" target="_blank" rel="external">Tobermory</a>, a place that my colleague said was a nice place to visit. She was right.</p>
<p>Just a few hours’ drive from wherever you think I live, and yet a few hours really isn’t the kind of time you would normally plan on wasting, I went on a drive there, again, for <em>absolutely no reason whatsoever</em>, to where the province’s national marine park lies.</p>
<p>Day one involved ending up at <a href="https://www.google.com/maps/place/Owen+Sound,+ON" target="_blank" rel="external">Owen Sound</a>, a town that tries to be a city, and subsequently travelling to Tobermory, where all the promises come true. Well, as it turned out, Owen Sound was a bit of a ghost town… at least for the parts it called downtown.</p>
<p>Ordered a takeout sushi bento for <em>absolutely no reason whatsoever</em>. For whatever reason, I always get Japanese food whenever I feel like <em>it</em>. <a href="http://yummyyummycuisine.ca/" target="_blank" rel="external">Yummy Yummy</a>, the place, half empty at the time, interestingly, was not bad. The salmon was dry and tasteless, but the rest of the bento box was great.</p>
<p>The Indian Falls was nearby, so I went there. After having just been to Elora, this manmade waterfall, (if it wasn’t manmade, it sure looks like it was.) despite its numerous defencive strategies to prevent the average hiker from reaching there (misleading paths), was underwhelming. I left soon afterwards.</p>
<p>The journey continued on with a drive to Cape Croker, apparently a native American stronghold, and the host of a lighthouse, creatively called the <a href="https://www.google.com/maps/place/Cape+Croker+Lighthouse/" target="_blank" rel="external">Cape Croker Lighthouse</a>. The path turned from tarmac to gravel, but my car journeyed on. When I arrived, it was covered with pride. And nearby cluster flies.</p>
<p>No time to waste. Time to actually go to Tobermory. I buckled up (hehe) and cruise controlled all the way to the motel, the place that claimed to be a motel, but was actually much nicer. Friendly man there explained that there was a router, but there was effectively no Wi-Fi inside my room. Nice. He also brought forth a helpful map… in retrospect, not that helpful, because “downtown” is literally that one street (Bay St.), and the big/little tubs (like bays or lagoons).</p>
<p>Well, guy said the <a href="https://www.google.com/maps/place/Big+Tub+Lighthouse/" target="_blank" rel="external">Big Tub Lighthouse</a> was 45 minutes of walking, but only 2 minutes of drive away. <em>Challenge Accepted.</em> The drive ended up to be more like four minutes, but it was fast nevertheless. The lighthouse was one of the most complete, best preserved lighthouses on this trip.</p>
<p>Had dinner at the creatively-named <a href="https://www.google.com/maps/place/The+Fish+%26+Chip+Place/@45.2547777,-81.6635033,19z/data=!4m12!1m6!3m5!1s0x0:0x14ed757805c10e4!2sThe+Coffee+Shop!8m2!3d45.2545111!4d-81.6635294!3m4!1s0x0:0x814d18d19f9ab060!8m2!3d45.2547542!4d-81.6630808" target="_blank" rel="external">“The Fish and Chip Place”</a>. It advertised Georgian Bay Whitefish, which, of course, I had to try. It tasted rather gamy. That one museum I visited later tomorrow taught me why.</p>
<p>Wait, it was 7pm and there was one more hour left until sunset. What would Jesus do? He would go to The Grotto! Driving there, the camp guard said the national park was actually closed, no one was here to handle the ticketing, and that if I were to go see The Grotto, I would be there after sunset, and it would be impossible to see anything.</p>
<p>Challenge Accepted, as usual.</p>
<p>And challenge completed.</p>
<p>The view was breathtaking. The rocks, the sun, the open bay.</p>
<p>But I knew I would be in trouble if I do not exit the national park by the time the sun actually sets, so I rushed back to my car.</p>
<p>The morning after, I purchased a light roast coffee from what they call <a href="https://www.google.com/maps/place/The+Coffee+Shop/@45.2547777,-81.6635033,19.38z/data=!4m5!3m4!1s0x0:0x14ed757805c10e4!8m2!3d45.2545111!4d-81.6635294" target="_blank" rel="external">The Coffee Shop</a>. Next, I visited the Visitors Centre, where I should have gone the night before. It was a great hike, full of interesting fungi, and to the watchtower, where I saw the largest unbroken stretch of forest in Southern Ontario.</p>
<p>Having booked a cruise to the Flowerpot Island, part of the <a href="https://www.google.com/maps/place/Fathom+Five+National+Marine+Park/@45.2825747,-81.6312099,11.92z/data=!4m5!3m4!1s0x0:0xf781ff1812dfe401!8m2!3d45.2818924!4d-81.7238617" target="_blank" rel="external">Fathom Five National Marine Park</a>, I took a glass bottom ship around the bay, the shipwreck, and the lighthouse I had visited the night before.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.google.com/maps/place/Flowerpot+Island/@45.2966019,-81.6144883,13.67z/data=!4m5!3m4!1s0x0:0xf3483ffdba2555cf!8m2!3d45.2988072!4d-81.61726" target="_blank" rel="external">The flowerpot island</a> featured three fantastic hikes, two flowerpots, and an amazing Parks Canada staff called Sheila (I think). She was just so enthusiastic about her work, despite all that it was being talking about the island, and ahanding out plastic bags all day long. She left a distinct memory in my mind. She had a very bright smile. She told me all about the island, including the plants and exotic orchids that were not flowering at the time. She loved her work. She loved Georgian Bay. She loved Canada.</p>
<p>I took place in two of the hikes. The first hike, which everyone goes on and back out of, was good. At the end was a lighthouse, or, more accurately, a lightstation, which was underwhelming compared to the sights from the viewing platform. The second hike, towards <a href="https://www.google.com/maps/place/Tobermory,+ON/@45.297085,-81.6285995,16.75z/data=!4m5!3m4!1s0x4d2d0ba9fb4f9461:0x3b2e70b0e46a3526!8m2!3d45.2533625!4d-81.6645411" target="_blank" rel="external">Marl Bed</a>, a place so hidden it is not even visible on Google Maps, was a bit more difficult. With 50 minutes left to spare before the return ship arrives, I ventured on.</p>
<p>Jesus <em>does</em> provide.</p>
<p>The express ship back was nothing short of exciting; thank the cruise booking staff for “accidentally” booking this ship for me, so that I had two hours of hiking time. And thank her for booking the fast ship back, for it was a unique(ly exciting) experience on a choppy sea.</p>
<p>On my way back, I visited Inglis Falls, the place I had missed completely on my way to Owen Sound. It looked a lot better than Indian Falls. Of course, after having been to Banff, nothing really quite surprised me.</p>
<p>All this, I was incredibly lucky in visiting the area while taking a weekday off. Had I not done that, it would have been packed with people everywhere I go. A weekday trip made the town exquisite, pleasant, and photogenic as well.</p>
<p>The overall fuel consumption was 6.05 L/100km. It will probably never hit that low again.</p>

    	<p>With the number of developers boom from 200 to 6000, Matt Ranney, the chief systems architect,, decided to give a talk about what he wish he knew from scaling up so quickly.</p>
<h1 id="Don’t-make-microservices-for-the-sake-of-making-microservices"><a href="#Don’t-make-microservices-for-the-sake-of-making-microservices" class="headerlink" title="Don’t make microservices for the sake of making microservices"></a>Don’t make microservices for the sake of making microservices</h1><p>Microservices have surprising downsides. </p>
<p>If you are building a lot of them, you start to realise that there is a risk in breaking something whenever they are changed. There is a surprising benefit to not touching a microservice if it works.</p>
<h2 id="Speed"><a href="#Speed" class="headerlink" title="Speed"></a>Speed</h2><p>RPC is always slower than PC, and microservices are all about RPC. At some point, there is a cost to the complexity of RPC as well.</p>
<p>Your function call is now asynchronous.<br>Your function call suddenly needs to understand status codes.<br>Your function call suddenly needs schema validation.</p>
<h2 id="Politics"><a href="#Politics" class="headerlink" title="Politics"></a>Politics</h2><p>If developers don’t like the design decision of something, they might just add a knob, or maybe make their own copy of the same thing that does something differently, so they can keep their biases in how something should be done. The problem: the cost of having different languages in the stack is tremendous.</p>
<p>It is hard to share code between platforms.<br>It is hard to get developer to move between teams.<br>It fragments the development culture (different “beliefs”).</p>
<h1 id="Working-with-repos"><a href="#Working-with-repos" class="headerlink" title="Working with repos"></a>Working with repos</h1><p>There are many correct answer to managing repositories, and “one repo” is not necessarily the wrong answer.<br>Uber has 8000 repositories, mainly developers’ personal ones nevertheless, but some teams also split code repositories from configuration management repositories. </p>
<h1 id="Releasing-things"><a href="#Releasing-things" class="headerlink" title="Releasing things"></a>Releasing things</h1><p>Teams now depend on the services from other teams, so if one team lags behind, so do other teams.<br>They will need to find a compromise in terms of coordinating releases.</p>
<h1 id="Performance"><a href="#Performance" class="headerlink" title="Performance"></a>Performance</h1><h2 id="You-don’t-need-to-know-how-fast-your-thing-is-as-long-as-you-know-it-is-fast-enough"><a href="#You-don’t-need-to-know-how-fast-your-thing-is-as-long-as-you-know-it-is-fast-enough" class="headerlink" title="You don’t need to know how fast your thing is, as long as you know it is fast enough"></a>You don’t need to know how fast your thing is, as long as you know it is fast enough</h2><p>Establish a benchmark performance “SLA” with the teams that use your service, e.g. “this call will definitely complete under 10 seconds”. You know you can take as long as 10 seconds, and you know you won’t need to worry about it until the performance drops below that threshold.</p>
<h2 id="Fanout"><a href="#Fanout" class="headerlink" title="Fanout"></a>Fanout</h2><p>If everyone’s services “tend to be on the slow case”, then the overall service will be slow. That is no good; it is good to establish some sort of distributed tracing, so we can understand why something is slow overall.</p>
<h2 id="Transactions"><a href="#Transactions" class="headerlink" title="Transactions"></a>Transactions</h2><p>“Distributed transactions” in microservice architecture <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/30213456/transactions-across-rest-microservices" target="_blank" rel="external">make no sense</a>. If two things need to be done transactionally, they probably should be in the same microservice.</p>
<h2 id="Dashboards"><a href="#Dashboards" class="headerlink" title="Dashboards"></a>Dashboards</h2><p>All dashboards should be automatically generated. If you don’t do that, all the teams making their own microservices will be making different dashboards that no one understands.<br>Flame graphs are great.</p>
<h1 id="Logging"><a href="#Logging" class="headerlink" title="Logging"></a>Logging</h1><p>Make logging consistent. Don’t log too mush either–logs are not free. Logging can slow down the overall service.</p>
<h1 id="Load-testing"><a href="#Load-testing" class="headerlink" title="Load testing"></a>Load testing</h1><p>You will eventually want a way to load test on production without affecting the metrics that you collect from production.<br>You will need a way to tag “test traffic”.</p>
<h1 id="“Failure-testing”"><a href="#“Failure-testing”" class="headerlink" title="“Failure testing”"></a>“Failure testing”</h1><p>(…)</p>
<h1 id="Migrations"><a href="#Migrations" class="headerlink" title="Migrations"></a>Migrations</h1><p>Migrations sort of have to work before and after they take place. Unfortunately, teams will have to account for that. Fortunately (for Uber), microservices are easier to migrate than monolithic codebases, so they have dodged a bullet there.</p>
<h1 id="Conclusion"><a href="#Conclusion" class="headerlink" title="Conclusion"></a>Conclusion</h1><p>Despite all these helpful tips, Guy concluded with a dark note: “you’ll probably have to learn it to hard way.”</p>

    	<p>I don’t know.</p>
<p><a href="https://blog.g3rt.nl/upgrade-your-ssh-keys.html" target="_blank" rel="external">This article</a> says I should:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Generate your new key with <code>ssh-keygen -o -a 100 -t ed25519</code>, specify a strong passphrase and read further if you need a smooth transition.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So I went with</p>
<pre><code>ssh-keygen -o -a 2147483647 -t ed25519
</code></pre><p><code>MAX_INT</code> number of rounds should be more than enough to secure my passphrase, which is 80000 characters long.</p>
<p>But the article seems to disagree.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Is this the ultimate secure SSH keypair?<br>(…)  use hardware security (smart cards) to avoid leaking keys (…)<br>I’m planning on writing some more on how to harden SSH a bit more; custom host keys, custom DH moduli, strong ciphers (e.g. chacha20-poly1305)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This meant trouble for my SSH key. It means that I should change my cipher to <code>chacha20-poly1305</code>, and then place the key on a smartcard. But how many open source <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smart_key" target="_blank" rel="external">smartcard</a> vendors are there?</p>
<p>I don’t think I know any!</p>

    	<p><strong>tl;dr</strong>: Not much.</p>
<p>While mucking about with my phone in traditional Chinese, I discovered that some of the words in <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.urbandroid.sleep" target="_blank" rel="external">Sleep as Android</a> show up as simplified Chinese. As that is <a href="http://www.scmp.com/comment/blogs/article/1286903/using-simplified-chinese-sin" target="_blank" rel="external">easily an act of war</a>, apparently, I notified the SaA team of this issue.</p>
<p>The reply I got was an invitation to translate the <strong>zh-rTW</strong> strings file for the app. Immediately, I learned (1) that Android’s zh strings suffices have an <code>r</code> before it, whatever it is.</p>
<p>I accepted the invitation. Opening the document, I found that all of the strings are, well, already translated. What gives?</p>
<p>Googling the problem, I found that <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/4189875/simplified-and-traditional-chinese-vs-regions" target="_blank" rel="external"><strong>zh-rHK</strong> is not even an Android locale</a>, and that its existence in CyanogenMod is purely generosity. Well, or so I think. The problem with doing that is <a href="https://github.com/getnikola/nikola/issues/1637" target="_blank" rel="external">zh-rHK actually falls back to zh-rCN</a>, which is simplified Chinese. Blasphemy!</p>
<p>I suggested the SaA team <a href="https://github.com/owncloud/android/tree/master/res/values-zh-rHK" target="_blank" rel="external">copy the zh-rTW file as zh-rHK</a>, so as to maintain the sovereignty of the People’s Republic of Hong Kong. They sent back an updated beta and it was fixed. We did it, Hong Kong!</p>

    	<p><a href="https://xkcd.com/320/" target="_blank" rel="external">One of the first xkcd comics</a> (#320) describes a 28-hour day, where six of such days sum up to 168 hours, which is also what seven 24-hour days add up to. The person would then stay up for 20 hours, sleep eight hours after that, and repeat the process. Of course, ignoring the daylight factor (which, if you have a daylight-dependent sleeping schedule, you would not be reading this in the first place), a person still needs to work, play, planning such a six-day week around the world that revolves around them. What does that look like?</p>
<p><img src="/image/7-day.png" alt=""></p>
<p>If your workplace allows somewhat flexible hours, or if they only specify core hours, then by shifting your Tuesday schedule a bit late, and your Friday schedule a bit early, then you are only 10% deviated from the rest of the world, in a typical 40-hour work week. If the place of employment really wants you to put 40 hours during <em>their</em> workdays, just shift that excel spreadsheet left by four days. Now, you start work two hours early on their Monday, and start two hours late on their Friday. In such a plan, like normal human beings, you will not be working during normal weekends.</p>
<h2 id="What-does-it-look-like-to-you"><a href="#What-does-it-look-like-to-you" class="headerlink" title="What does it look like to you?"></a>What does it look like to you?</h2><p><img src="/image/6-day.png" alt=""></p>
<p>At first, if you commit to centering your life around your sleep, then you get eight hours of sleep at “midnight” every day. The time at which you leave for work will be drastically different every “day”. On day 1 (whatever name you give it), you will work at 10am. On day 4, you will start working at 8pm, finishing at “28pm”, your midnight.</p>
<h2 id="Bonus-exercise-when-do-shops-open"><a href="#Bonus-exercise-when-do-shops-open" class="headerlink" title="Bonus exercise: when do shops open?"></a>Bonus exercise: <em>when do shops open?</em></h2><p>Enough about work. Your life is a lot more than just work. How about food? How about entertainment? When are things open relative to your 6-day week? Well, highlighting the 9am~7pm range, when shops are typically open and available to you?</p>
<p><img src="/image/6-day-ds.png" alt=""></p>
<p>Well, as it turns out, there are not that many hours that you have to shop when both you and other human beings are awake. On most days, you can get away with shopping after work; it might be a bit strange for your “weekend” day, for there are three shopping hours immediately after you wake up, and three more right before you go to bed. No more eight-hour activities for you!</p>
