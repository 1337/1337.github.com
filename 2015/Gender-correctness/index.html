    	<p>On Facebook, you can occasionally see blank avatars that look like a man with short hair, or avatars that look like <a href="https://www.facebook.com/pages/Default-female-FB-avatar-sorta-looks-like-Darth-Vader/192167327472723" target="_blank" rel="external">Darth Vader</a>.</p>
<p>As it turns out, the latter is Facebook’s idea of an anonymous female person. And that is, insofar as <a href="http://www.apa.org/pi/lgbt/resources/sexuality-definitions.pdf" target="_blank" rel="external">gender identity</a> is concerned, politically incorrect.</p>
<p>Just earlier today, I was schooled by a colleague of mine about my political incorrectness:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Gender is a spectrum, and many people don’t identify simply as “him” or “her”.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I thought they (my colleague, as a singular person/being, who appears to be male, but did not specifically identify in particular) had the right idea there, and I agree, perhaps catering for just 90% of anything is being ignorant. Being a start-up (startup?), why not go the extra mile to cater to those we care about?</p>
<p>While calling someone (or some <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Otherkin" target="_blank" rel="external">otherkin</a>?) <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ignorance" target="_blank" rel="external">ignorant</a> would be a serious accusation, the general idea would still stand. <a href="http://www.goodreads.com/quotes/tag/willful-ignorance" target="_blank" rel="external">The sole fact of you rejecting the notion that you are ignorant is being ignorant</a>, unless you also accept that (presumably facts) which are delivered to you, in which case, you are not ignorant, because you have taken in information from others.</p>
<p>A major problem with this mode of thinking is that <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Argument_from_ignorance#Basic_argument" target="_blank" rel="external">it is impossible to disprove your ignorance without being viewed as ignorant in the first place</a>. Then again, who cares, right? It’s not like anyone <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/tumblrinaction" target="_blank" rel="external">rejects to the thought of being open-minded</a>. You open your mind to everything others tell you, you become one of them, everybody wins.</p>
<h2 id="Never-refer-to-someone-as-“male”-or-“female”"><a href="#Never-refer-to-someone-as-“male”-or-“female”" class="headerlink" title="Never refer to someone as “male” or “female”"></a>Never refer to someone as “male” or “female”</h2><p>When you see someone (or some <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Otherkin" target="_blank" rel="external">otherkin</a>) on the streets, it is politically incorrect to assume that such as being is male or female. In fact, <a href="http://www.ndsu.edu/lgbtq/faq/" target="_blank" rel="external">many people and beings</a> refer to themselves as at least eight other types of identities:</p>
<ul>
<li>L: Lesbian</li>
<li>G: Gay</li>
<li>B: Bisexual</li>
<li>T: Transgender or Transsexual</li>
<li>Q: Queer or Questioning</li>
<li>I: Intersex (previously referred to as “hermaphrodite”, but Intersex is the more acceptable term to use now)</li>
<li>A: Asexual or Ally</li>
<li>2-S: Two Spirit (drawn from Native culture to refer to people who walk in two worlds – female and male)</li>
<li>(and many more; see <a href="http://www.ndsu.edu/lgbtq/faq/" target="_blank" rel="external">source</a>)</li>
</ul>
<p>While I am admittedly ignorant in that I have heard of, but never bothered, to learn about the “Ally” gender, or the difference between being two-spirit and intersex, I have learned today that I should at least never refer to anyone as just male or female, or either male or female, for that matter.</p>
<p>Much like you cannot call an African American person with that word they call each other, if someone self-identifies as male, that is <em>not</em> grounds for you (even if you identify as a male) to refer to such a person/being as “him”. This is your ignorance spewing out of your old-fashioned brain.</p>
<h2 id="Assume-all-terms-will-offend-unless-otherwise-given-permission"><a href="#Assume-all-terms-will-offend-unless-otherwise-given-permission" class="headerlink" title="Assume all terms will offend unless otherwise given permission"></a>Assume all terms will offend unless otherwise given permission</h2><p>Many people/beings care about what you don’t care about, and that does not make what they care about any less important than what you care about.</p>
<p>Just because, say, you self-identify as either male or female, and 90% of your friends and family self-identify as either male or female, it does not change the fact that there are many people/beings out there (10% of 6 billion [humans] is 600 million, right?) who self-identify as neither of these, regardless of their sex by birth. See: <a href="http://www.apa.org/pi/lgbt/resources/sexuality-definitions.pdf" target="_blank" rel="external">Sex, Gender, Gender Identity and Sexual Orientation</a>.</p>
<p>Such words and/or phrases you use to describe a person/being may offend them. These are called <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trauma_trigger" target="_blank" rel="external">triggers</a>; they put people/beings into a state of trauma.</p>
<p>As a result, if a person/being self-identifies to you as female, for example, it <em>should not</em> mean anything to you in understanding them (that person/being, a singular). The person/being self-identifies as female. That only gives that person/being the right to call themselves a female; it does not give you the right to call themselves a female.</p>
<p>Only when a person/being says,</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Please identify me as (one of the choices above), (your name),</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Should you be allowed to identify them as the choice specified.</p>
<h2 id="Never-be-offended"><a href="#Never-be-offended" class="headerlink" title="Never be offended"></a>Never be offended</h2><p>You need to play your part in this, of course! When someone says anything that upsets you, do not take it seriously. Instead, treat the offender with respect.</p>
<p>For example, if someone says you are disgusting and tells you to go fuc* yourself, don’t dwell on the fact that someone called you disgusting; focus on how you can improve yourself instead.</p>
<h2 id="Accommodate-the-minority-for-what-they-identify-to-be"><a href="#Accommodate-the-minority-for-what-they-identify-to-be" class="headerlink" title="Accommodate the minority for what they identify to be"></a>Accommodate the minority for what they identify to be</h2><p>No rule in (your country) sets forth the number of genders from which one may choose to identify; you can identify as any gender you want, including genders apart from the “popular” ones listed above.</p>
<p>Bear in mind that other people/beings can identify under a unique gender, as well.</p>
<p>Imagine a <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0149460/" target="_blank" rel="external">Futurama</a>-like world where a person/being you see on the streets can be a human, an alien, or a sewage dweller. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Mutants_Are_Revolting" target="_blank" rel="external">People/beings in that world respect each other</a>, communicate with each other as if they are the same kind. This is the world we are currently gearing towards, except there is no visual difference between each identifiable gender, unlike each species found in Futurama.</p>
<p>When a person/being claims to be a gay, please treat them like a normal person/being. Do note, “normal” changes quite a lot, so please keep up with the society for the correct way to deal with each situation.</p>
<h2 id="Have-fun"><a href="#Have-fun" class="headerlink" title="Have fun"></a>Have fun</h2><p>Gays, queers, bisexuals… they all enjoy the world like you do, and all deserve to live a life they ought them to be. If you are gender identity-agnostic, everyone/every being you meet are just like each other. So, have fun! Enjoy the world around you. There are a lot of genders to explore.</p>
