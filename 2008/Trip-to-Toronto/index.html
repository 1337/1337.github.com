    	<p>I had a tight schedule yesterday, because I had to go to the train station right after church, so that I can catch a train to downtown Toronto. This is my first time going downtown alone, so I needed a lot of help.</p>
<p>Surrogate helped search for the correct train route to get to Union Station (the main station). While I was waiting for the train, I started a conversation with a cyclist called Michael, a young (25ish?) white male, who was also waiting for the train. He was wrapped in spandex and had a good racing bike. we talked on the train, about life (“I was born in Nova Scotia” “Same here”) and death (“The people where I came from have no place to get themselves buried” “wow”) and everything in between (“The Canadian dollar is dropping like-“ “I know”), all the way until we got to Union station.</p>
<p>We didn’t exchange numbers because I don’t think there’s anything to do even IF we meet again. What, meet up for tea or something? I thanked him for his help around the station, and we went our own ways.</p>
<p>I got to That Guy’s place (University of Toronto) by the transit system (“TTC”). His campus wasn’t big, but is entirely accessible by car. Waterloo’s academic buildings are rarely accessible by cars - and there are tons of parking spaces for that reason.</p>
<p>The other guy from McMaster and another man from Waterloo were at That Guy’s dorm as well, because they came over for thanksgiving too. We four went out the whole day and bought bubble tea. Considering the non-locality of this speciality, the bubble tea was actually pretty good.</p>
<p>The Asiatown here is massive. At least it’s massive compared to what we have in Waterloo (“there is none”). We walked around Chinatown, went to Eaton Center (the big shopping mall everyone makes a big deal about) and froze all the computers in the newly open Apple store, all thanks to another man from Waterloo, the mac expert.</p>
<p>We went to a book store there and read mini books which they sell. Looking at these books, I might consider making mini books again…. they have market. Apparently.</p>
<p>We walked for 9 hours in total, covering the day from 12pm to 10pm. We had dinner at an empty pizza shop because everywhere else was packed. We had an idea why the shop was empty - the cashier doesn’t have good attitude. Beggars asking us for food too, and we gave him excess onion rings. We could have given him more garlic bread but we forgot.</p>
<p>There are 6000 homeless people in this town, but nobody really cares… </p>
