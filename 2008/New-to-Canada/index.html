    	<p>Have you ever had the feeling where you’ve left a place you used to live for so long that it felt alien when you returned? That was exactly how I felt when I got to the Pearson airport. The people there were mostly white, though most of the “may I help you?” luggage people were Indians… I didn’t recall seeing any of that years ago.</p>
<p>Road signs were all in English. French words which you thought you could read but couldn’t. Miles of plain grass and undeveloped lands. Highways sparsely populated. And the most spectacular - clean sky, beautiful clouds, and a sunset everyone here takes for granted.</p>
<p>I moved into campus residence at the end of August. To accomplish this, things needed to be bought in advance. Such things are obviously cheaper wherever I came from, but were not bought there because of their mass/weight/relative uselessness:</p>
<ul>
<li>Washing detergent<br>For dishes and clothes. Both are heavy, chemical fluids. You won’t be able to board a plane with them, nor will you want to.</li>
<li>Shampoo, body wash, etc etc<br>Again, huge bottles of chemicals. Leaks on impact, confiscated at customs.</li>
<li>Books for this term only</li>
<li>Some medicine<br>“Tylenol” seems remarkably cheaper here than it is in Hong Kong - 6 CAD for 100 tablets. Treats fevers, colds and headaches, the most common problems for university students. Why not?</li>
<li>Blanket sheets, tissue, binders, printer, winter clothing<br>Items which are not worth bringing over, were not brought over.</li>
<li>Paper<br>Cheap and bulky.</li>
</ul>
<p>On more than two occasions, someone invited me to their basement to look for my old property. It was good to see those things again. Some things were more useful than others:</p>
<ul>
<li>I found yet another Swiss knife key chain from my pile of junk. So now I have 3 with me and I’ll probably be bring at least one to university for, maybe, opening cans and such.</li>
<li>A large quantity of stationery was trashed: old pens can’t write, rulers frozen into half, etc.</li>
<li>Lots of clothing. Many were too small, but some can still be kept.</li>
<li>Coins.</li>
<li>Folders, binder tabs, scissors, cutters, etc: essential tools for success.</li>
<li>Rollerblades: it can possibly be useful in a huge campus like this one.</li>
<li>Dictionaries - but I’m probably not going to need one</li>
</ul>
<p>The Surrogate family also contributed a lot to this brian-is-going-to-uni-for-his-first-time project, and it’s noteworthy that not only did they sacrifice their time / effort / food / accommodation / gasoline (which they might claim money for) for this project, they have also provided at least the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>AA batteries (I don’t know where they got them, but I don’t see them buying them specifically) for the</li>
<li>flashlight, which they also found in their basement</li>
<li>Stapler, and a whole pack of staples</li>
<li>Double clips</li>
<li>Maps</li>
<li>Some clothes they never knew existed</li>
<li>Plain paper</li>
<li>Blankets, pillows, and their covers</li>
<li>An abandoned mug warmer</li>
<li>Some of their medicine</li>
<li>Tissue</li>
</ul>
<p>During the week between the day of arrival and the day I moved into the campus, we’ve also spent hundreds of dollars, purchasing items necessary for school, partially mentioned above. Bills will probably be mailed to you soon and the figures won’t look interesting. I think you say “don’t worry about the fees” because you haven’t seen the bills just yet.</p>
