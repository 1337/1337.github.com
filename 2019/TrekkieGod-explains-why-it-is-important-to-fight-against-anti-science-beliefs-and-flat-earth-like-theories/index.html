    	<p><strong>tl;dr</strong>: Ignorance leads to bigotry. And then they vote.</p>
<p>Emphasis mine:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>What real effect (do alternative facts) have on your or their daily life?</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>The effect is so great, I can’t think of a single more important task to undertake.<br>You’re thinking, “who cares if somebody thinks the Earth is flat,” and you’re missing the bigger picture: this is just one symptom of a population incapable of critical thinking.<br>Some people who don’t believe in scientific evidence and think the government is lying to them believe vaccines cause autism. They’re responsible for an increase in the number of measles cases, including in the small percentage of people who were vaccinated, but the vaccine wasn’t effective for them, or can’t be vaccinated for legitimate medical reasons.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Some people who don’t believe in scientific evidence and think the government is lying refuse to accept global warming is real. <strong>They’re actively voting against candidates supporting investment in renewable technologies of the future</strong>, and against a carbon tax that would not only help migration towards these technologies, but offset the cost in disaster relief the government is having to spend due to current increase in number and severity of weather events like hurricanes as a result of global warming. It’s an externality of fossil fuels: we’re already paying the carbon tax, in the form of extra expenditures, (…) but we haven’t associated that cost with the fossil fuels, so it looks like it’s cheaper than it is and slows down the switch to green tech.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Some people who don’t believe in scientific evidence elect school board members who don’t believe in evolution and require text books that “teach the controversy,” and downplay the scientific evidence. They’re lowering the quality of our public schools.<br>Some people who think all beliefs are the same, and science is just another religion, call educated individuals the “intellectual elite” for acting like they know better than they do. Entirely missing the point that they do. That’s what education is, the gaining of additional knowledge. It’s incredible to me how many people refuse to listen to economists, or climate scientists, or physicists, or evolutionary biologists, because they think their opinion is worth just as much. Simultaneously, these people want an actual lawyer if they go to court, and an actual doctor of they’re sick. Although, there are those who don’t, and they’re even worse: people who chose to defend themselves in court and go to jail when they’re innocent, which is not only an injustice, but it’s a drain on my tax dollars. Parents who refuse to allow a doctor to give a simple treatment that would cure their child in favor of their faith healer, and the child dies instead. These people tend to go to jail too for negligence, and not only was an innocent life lost, it’s again <strong>a drain on my tax dollars</strong>.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>The type of ignorance is responsible for random acts of violence. A conspiracy nut who believed in pizzagate shot up a pizza parlor in NYC because he believed there was a child sex ring in the basement. There was no basement.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>This type of ignorance leads to bigots. <strong>There’s nothing wrong with faith, but when they believe their faith is a fact and that they can’t be wrong</strong>, they discriminate against homosexuals, against people of other faiths, against people of no faiths. Polls consistently show Americans would rather vote for a pedophile than an atheist, and considering Roy Moore almost won his election, it’s not hyperbole. He got the votes he did because he pandered to the faith above fact crowd: global warming is a hoax, no abortion, Muslims should not be able to hold office in the US, etc.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>The flat earthers are just the extreme case of the above. There’s an overlap of the above beliefs, as well as a specific disinclination for voting towards candidates that wasn’t to fund NASA and other studies. We just got a picture of a black hole 54 million light-years away. <strong>You think these people support funding scientific efforts in a field they don’t believe in?</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>But don’t narrow yourself to this specific unscientific belief. The flat earthers are one example. <strong>Willingness to ignore scientific evidence is the problem, no matter what field.</strong> We must fight against it whenever we see it, we must seek to educate, we must seek to find out what causes people to get in that state and restructure education to help prevent it. If we could solve this one problem, we’ll build paradise on Earth. <strong>Every other problem we have is solvable with time, if humans stop denying evidence in favor of what they want to believe.</strong> And it’s hard. I’m not saying I’m better than these people, I’m human too. I know I must do it from time to time, and not realize it. I want people to engage me when it happens, I want them to snap me out of it, and <strong>I want to live with a philosophy of constant questioning of my own convictions</strong> in an attempt to minimize that behavior in me, and make it easier to correct it when it does happen.</p>
