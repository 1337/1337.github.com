    	<p>Many of us have done the <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/professional-development-program/courses/pd1-career-fundamentals" target="_blank" rel="external">PD 1</a> course over at Waterloo, whose primary purpose is to ready students with the skills required to get their first job. One of these skills taught is “Develop their resumes through feedback and in-person critiques”.</p>
<p>Back when I did my PD 1—in the 15th century, when the Roman Empire was still a thing—I was actually told to follow exactly PD’s given example resume format, which I thought was simple, direct, but ugly AF. It also recommended <a href="http://forums.redflagdeals.com/why-does-pd1-loo-teaches-you-wrong-way-write-resume-891059/" target="_blank" rel="external">two-page resumes</a>, which have since fallen out of favour.</p>
<p>In particular, my PD 1 recommended resumes with the following properties:</p>
<ul>
<li>Stick to that template style. 12-point Arial, indents, line heights, everything.</li>
<li>Put <em>both</em> your local and mailing address in there.</li>
<li>For some reason, every previous work experience needs three to four, and no other number, of highlights.</li>
</ul>
<p>My PD 1 (and, subsequently, my entire internship career) resume looked something like this.</p>
<p><img src="/image/resumetranscript-2-638.jpg" alt="Some poor sod&#39;s PD 1 resume I found online"></p>
<p>Granted, <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/uwaterloo/comments/32zd72/serious_if_upper_years_have_found_that_cecas/" target="_blank" rel="external">the point of PD 1’s resume advice is to prevent <em>terrible</em> resumes from being sent to employers</a>, the advice it gives can still be improved.</p>
<p>I am now old (over 500 years old now) and have read other people’s resumes. Here are the things I like and dislike about the ones I selected.</p>
<h2 id="Keep-it-short"><a href="#Keep-it-short" class="headerlink" title="Keep it short"></a>Keep it short</h2><p>Unless you are applying to a large company with dedicated full-time HR department, the person who reviews your resume (I’ll call that person a <em>reviewer</em>) is likely just someone who has a real job, is busy, and has more important work to do. They have no time to read your resumes; <strong>they have absolutely no time to appreciate your cover letters</strong>, especially if they are addressed to “whom it may concern”, or “Dear sirs/madams”. They don’t work. Please stop wasting each other’s time.</p>
<p>People—apart from those who designed PD 1—say “keep it to one page”, and they are right. Reviewers really have no time to read two pages worth of techno-babble <em>per candidate</em>. By the time I (a reviewer) get to the second page, I will have already forgotten the contents of the first. Often I even forget your name by the time I finish page two. <strong>Two pages is too long for me</strong>, but there may be exceptions.</p>
<p>Speaking of keeping it within one-page, some candidates choose to cram the same stuff onto one page by “wiggling the rules a bit”. Decreasing the font size, changing to a narrower font, putting things in multiple columns, lowering line height, and even shrinking letter spacing… <em>please</em> stop making your resume hard to read. <strong>A one-page resume that is hard to read is worse than a two-page resume.</strong></p>
<h2 id="Cut-the-crap"><a href="#Cut-the-crap" class="headerlink" title="Cut the crap"></a>Cut the crap</h2><p>Now that you know reviewers don’t like reviewing, you need to trim the fat from your two-page resume. There are some things that you simply need not specify, saving both your and your reviewer’s time.</p>
<ul>
<li>You are expected to be a fast learner. There is no need to mention it.</li>
<li>You are expected to work well with other team members. There is no need to mention it.</li>
<li>You are expected to know how to use Microsoft Office. There is no need to mention it (unless the job description asks for it).</li>
<li>We all know “experience in technology foo” means “almost no experience in technology foo.” If you aren’t actually good at something, you waste space mentioning it.</li>
</ul>
<p>And if you are a co-founder of a company, <em>please</em> make sure company is real. There is no such thing as being a co-founder of a fictional company, but there is such a thing called “fraud”.</p>
<h2 id="Keep-it-professional"><a href="#Keep-it-professional" class="headerlink" title="Keep it professional"></a>Keep it professional</h2><p>Some resumes like to list their owner’s hobbies (“soccer”, “skiing”, “photography”…). There is no good reason to list your interests and hobbies on your resume. Reviewers don’t care if you follow Manchester United. Instead, they check if you have any relevant skills listed, so that they can easily tell if the company should hire you <em>for work</em>.</p>
<h2 id="Make-it-easy-to-read"><a href="#Make-it-easy-to-read" class="headerlink" title="Make it easy to read"></a>Make it easy to read</h2><p>The point of a resume is both to showcase your experience, and to make the reader believe that you are the ideal hire, <strong>in under a minute</strong>. To communicate this in under a minute, your resume must be easy to read, easy to digest, and what they read must be impressive.</p>
<p>First, <strong>list your skills</strong>, because companies hire you for your skills, not for your education, personality, or even education sometimes.</p>
<p>Then, (if this is a technical resume) <strong>list specific tools that you have worked with</strong>, to let the reader know your background better. For example, listing “Python” can mean many things, so mentioning “pyTorch” means you have machine learning experience, while “Flask” means you do web development.</p>
<p>If you have a Summary section, you have to make sure it actually summarises.</p>
<p>Make sure you list these tools and frameworks in every work experience that you have listed.</p>
<p>List numbers (e.g. “<strong>$50000 saved</strong>“), figures (e.g. “<strong>5x improvement</strong>“), and make sure they are clearly emphasised. This makes them easy to spot when your reviewer has only a minute to spare.</p>
<p><strong>Use contrast to your advantage.</strong> It is important to highlight certain things, even if it means de-emphasising other things. It doesn’t matter if you worked in New York (apart from your current job, maybe); it matters what impact you made there. It doesn’t matter when you started a job; it matters if you are still there. If something isn’t important, <em>make sure</em> it looks less important than the rest.</p>
<h2 id="Know-your-audience-know-your-job"><a href="#Know-your-audience-know-your-job" class="headerlink" title="Know your audience, know your job"></a>Know your audience, know your job</h2><p>If you are applying for a CS position, list your projects before your education.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/uwaterloo/comments/32zd72/serious_if_upper_years_have_found_that_cecas/cqg1prq/" target="_blank" rel="external">If you are applying for a finance position, list your grades—which are hopefully excellent—before your projects.</a></p>
<p>There may be technical reviewers who “know their shit”, so, putting “linux” and “latex” in your “programming languages” section may put you at a disadvantage.</p>
<h2 id="Don’t-disappoint-the-reader"><a href="#Don’t-disappoint-the-reader" class="headerlink" title="Don’t disappoint the reader"></a>Don’t disappoint the reader</h2><p>If you plan to put links in your PDF resumes, please make them clickable. Seeing a blue underline, clicking on it, and watch it do nothing, is more disappointing than not having a link to begin with. <strong>If there are dead links, please fix them.</strong></p>
<p>Links to your portfolio are welcome. But please have stuff in your portfolio. I have seen plenty of portfolios with just hello-worlds in them, and they are pathetic.</p>
<p>Oh, and please make your resume printable, and don’t waste my ink by making the background bright orange.</p>
<p><strong>tl;dr</strong> make it readable in under a minute.</p>
