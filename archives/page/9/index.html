<p>You can’t keep 100+ items in your head as you look at every method or clause in a code base, so you’re going to have to read the code over and over, looking for different things. - <a href="http://blog.smartbear.com/code-review/creating-your-code-review-checklist/" target="_blank" rel="external">Smartbear.com</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Apart from static checking, which your automation tools should already do, there are always a set of things to watch out for when you review your own, or others’ code.</p>
<h1 id="Semantics"><a href="#Semantics" class="headerlink" title="Semantics"></a>Semantics</h1><h2 id="Does-it-break-any-rules"><a href="#Does-it-break-any-rules" class="headerlink" title="Does it break any rules?"></a>Does it break any rules?</h2><p>The bronze rule of programming is minimising code complexity. <del>Code is more often run than read, which is why it must be optimised for speed</del> Code is more often read than written, which is why it must be optimised for reading. And in order for code to be easy to read, it does not matter how short or long or idiomatic it is, if it does not conform to what the rest of the codebase is doing.</p>
<p>For example: if the rest of the code uses <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/14788181/class-based-views-vs-function-based-views" target="_blank" rel="external">CBV</a> and you write a FBV because “flat is better than nested”, you are forcing the rest of the team to make a mental exception. And mental exceptions are very, very expensive.</p>
<p>Another example: if your database stores all masses in kilograms, and you swoop in and add two fields, one in grams and one in tonnes… although both units are SI (and therefore kosher), other coders must make mental exceptions for these fields. “Using the most appropriate unit” is not special enough to break the rules.</p>
<p>You may also be one of the aspiring interns in your company who know <em>a lot</em> about naming conventions in PHP (documented in whichever <a href="https://github.com/php-fig/fig-standards/blob/master/accepted/PSR-1-basic-coding-standard.md" target="_blank" rel="external">PSR</a>), so when it is your turn to make an impact, you write your classes in <code>StudlyCaps</code> and all their methods <code>camelCase</code>, even though all other code is already written <code>like_a_perl_god_did_it</code>. You are technically correct; <a href="http://s2.quickmeme.com/img/25/25ba1b8d1640f9f2180399b24648097fca79bbfc3d9dd36a229c1b9b37f32532.jpg" target="_blank" rel="external">it is not the right time and place</a>.</p>
<h2 id="Is-this-good-code"><a href="#Is-this-good-code" class="headerlink" title="Is this good code?"></a>Is this good code?</h2><p>Just because you maxed out your static checks and lowered your max cyclomatic complexity to 0 (nb. this doesn’t work) and the code passes all tests and static checks, it doesn’t mean the code is good. In fact, if you improperly configured your static checks, your developers can occasionally write code that is even uglier that it needs to be, just to bypass the draconian checks that you have imposed. For example, if every function is limited to 5 lines max, then there will be <em>a lot</em> of incomprehensible one-liners.</p>
<h2 id="Can-I-easily-explain-this-code-to-someone-else"><a href="#Can-I-easily-explain-this-code-to-someone-else" class="headerlink" title="Can I easily explain this code to someone else?"></a>Can I easily explain this code to someone else?</h2><p>Explaining your own code to someone else is easy: you wrote it; you know the edge cases. What is much harder (and makes code reviews important) is whether you can review someone else’s code, and understand it well enough to relay your knowledge. It requires both you to have read the review thoroughly, and the code to be easy to understand.</p>
<p>If the implementation is hard to explain, it’s a bad idea. </p>
<h2 id="Should-this-code-be-here"><a href="#Should-this-code-be-here" class="headerlink" title="Should this code be here?"></a>Should this code be here?</h2><p>Bob wrote a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haversine_formula" target="_blank" rel="external">Haversine function</a> for calculating the distance between two lat/long pairs. Neat. He submits it for review. It passes all tests and builds. What would you do?<br>If your code is only meant to deal with lat/long pairs less than 100 metres apart, you are wasting your time; you are wasting the machine’s time. The code can be replaced with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pythagorean_theorem" target="_blank" rel="external">a middle school formula</a>. </p>
<h1 id="Languages-and-Tools"><a href="#Languages-and-Tools" class="headerlink" title="Languages and Tools"></a>Languages and Tools</h1><h2 id="JavaScript"><a href="#JavaScript" class="headerlink" title="JavaScript"></a>JavaScript</h2><ul>
<li>Are the docstrings actually correct?</li>
<li>Is any code using the side effect of an assignment as a value?</li>
<li>Are promises properly written, not in the manner of a callback hell?</li>
<li>Are <code>finally</code> promises written as <code>[&#39;finally&#39;]</code>, so that IE8 doesn’t register it as a keyword error?</li>
<li>Any unnecessary arguments being passed to any function/method? (Not the static check kind of unnecessary—the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Law_of_Demeter" target="_blank" rel="external">law of demeter</a> kind of unnecessary.)</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="Angular-1"><a href="#Angular-1" class="headerlink" title="Angular 1"></a>Angular 1</h3><ul>
<li>Is there <code>strict-di</code>?</li>
<li>Are controllers referenced using <code>controllerAs</code>?</li>
<li>Are services written using the <code>this</code> keyword?</li>
<li>Are custom-made scopes being destroyed manually? <em>Can</em> they be garbage-collected?</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="Python"><a href="#Python" class="headerlink" title="Python"></a>Python</h2><ul>
<li>Are any of the default function/method arguments mutable?</li>
<li>Is <code>print()</code> being used in production code?</li>
<li>If you wrote a function named <code>is_...</code> that returns anything other than <code>True</code> or <code>False</code>, did you ask yourself what you were doing?</li>
<li>Is everything public type-hinted? Are <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/typing.html#module-typing" target="_blank" rel="external">generic types</a> used where useful?</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="Django"><a href="#Django" class="headerlink" title="Django"></a>Django</h3><ul>
<li>Are there any extraneous commas after the field definition? (Something like <code>foo = models.Field(...),</code>, noting the trailing comma, will never be registered with Django as a field.)</li>
<li>Do model fields have <code>help_text</code>? Do foreign keys have <code>on_delete</code> and <code>related_name</code>? Are <code>DecimalField</code> defaults actually decimals?</li>
<li>Did any foreign keys get added? If so, are they blacklisted on their admin interfaces inside <code>raw_id_fields</code>?</li>
</ul>
<h1 id="Conclusion"><a href="#Conclusion" class="headerlink" title="Conclusion"></a>Conclusion</h1><p>Remember, you are not a machine, and you are supposed to be reviewing code in ways that machines cannot already do.<br>This requires critical thinking, and critical thinking requires clear thought, an evil mindset, and the ability to think outside the box.</p>

    	<p>I know about the <a href="https://www.veeam.com/blog/how-to-follow-the-3-2-1-backup-rule-with-veeam-backup-replication.html" target="_blank" rel="external">3-2-1 rule of backups</a> (3 copies of the same data in 2 types of media, with one offsite), but never really acted upon it. My usual backups only consist of my most important documents stored in another hard drive, which is, I figure, good enough. With the backup hard drive also aging, I look into different options, like Dropbox, Google Drive, and Syncthing.</p>
<p>The problem with Google Drive is that there is no desktop client available for Linux, and I must remember to back up the data manually, which I do not. What that means is the data that is backed up is neither useful or organised, with no sure way to tell if a document is up to date. If a backup is out of date, what is the point?</p>
<p>Then I give Dropbox a try. Dropbox, on the contrary, <a href="https://www.dropbox.com/install" target="_blank" rel="external">does have a Linux client</a>, and they have an online interface that shows history of individual files, which is a nice touch. That, of course, also has its downsides. Every file is accessible by Dropbox itself, and encryption software like <a href="https://cryptomator.org/" target="_blank" rel="external">Cryptomator</a> are under development, so once encrypted, there is no guarantee that the file can be accessed again.</p>
<p>Finally, Syncthing. Syncthing is the private BitTorrent of sorts, turning your machines into “seeders” for your own files, to be leeched by your own clients elsewhere. Sounds good on paper, but how do you make sure that remote server that you sync with does not expose these files to the filesystem? <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/privacytoolsIO/comments/4fb8h2/is_syncthing_zeroknowledge_and_other_questions/" target="_blank" rel="external">There is no way to do that</a>; you must have control over your own machines to make this sort of guarantee.</p>
<p>At this point, I seriously consider purchasing <a href="http://www.newegg.ca/Product/ProductList.aspx?Submit=ENE&amp;N=100006737%204018%204814%204017&amp;IsNodeId=1&amp;bop=And&amp;Order=PRICE&amp;PageSize=36" target="_blank" rel="external">a small desktop</a> dedicated for Syncthing. Whenever I change a file on my master laptop, the changes will be stored in that desktop. But hang on, the 3-2-1 rule says this desktop should be elsewhere. where would I put it?</p>
<p>I turn to my own parents. They are not free to do such a thing. I turn to cloud providers. I don’t like the idea of them having backdoors to their own disks (which is justified, in a way). I turn to my colleagues. They said along the lines of:</p>
<ul>
<li>There might be legal implications of me hosting your data</li>
<li>There might be legal implications of me hosting <em>illegal</em> data</li>
<li>I can’t guarantee the integrity of your backups</li>
<li>Having your data on my computer is a legal disaster</li>
<li>Having your data, even if you supply your own computer, connected to my home network, is still a legal disaster</li>
</ul>
<p>Speechless, I turn to yet another colleague, who suggests dumping encrypted backups to S3 or Glacier with a cron job.</p>
<p>But S3 is not free.<br>But it probably won’t complain about lawyers and stuff.<br>But you can’t restore from S3 like a human being.<br>But that’s what it’s like to have two different backup media.</p>
<p>Sigh. Tarsnap it is.</p>

<li>You can invite friends over only if you have the space. You might not have the space.</li>
<li>Losing keys can be a very costly ordeal.</li>
<li>No one to practice interviews with. Or talk to, on a daily basis.</li>
<li>If you torrent anything, they will know it is you.</li>
<li>Too much free space might pressure you to get all sorts of furniture you never needed.</li>
<li>You pay your own home insurance.</li>
<li>Snow? You are shovelling (where applicable). Grass? You might get away with paying a boy to cut it for you, but that also costs money.</li>

    	<p>The community list of red flags when assessing a roommate/potential roommate is as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>Insists on putting their name on their own food in the fridge, while eating all unlabelled food when no one else is doing it.</li>
<li>Has a mother move in for them. Chances are, this roommate will not be doing their own chores.</li>
<li>Expects the place to be clean, yet, does not clean anything.</li>
<li>Has a smell that lingers wherever they go.</li>
<li>Was forced to move out by their former roommates.</li>
<li>Is close to you. Once they move in, their flaws magnify. The closer you were, the more flaws you’ll find. Not a bad thing if they are nice though, since that magnifies positively as well.</li>
<li>Mentions how clean the place is before/upon move-in. Indicates different living/cleanliness standards.</li>
<li>Is a problem drunk. Sleep drunk is their own business.</li>
<li>Posts post-it notes in the house. Evidence of passive-aggression.</li>
<li>Always keeps the door open (sociopath), or always keeps the door closed (anti-social).</li>
<li>Leave dishes lying around.</li>
<li>For some reason, showers or poops with the door open, or showers and poops at the same time.</li>
<li>Uses metal utensils on non-stick pans (only madmen do this).</li>
<li>Has incredibly loud sex, but does not have the courtesy to invite you.</li>
<li>Drops weights on hardwood flooring.</li>
<li>Is alcoholic, and expects roommates carry them home.</li>
<li>Doesn’t have a job, and is not looking for one.</li>
<li>Has no sense of humour.</li>
<li>Distributes drugs outdoors as an occupation.</li>
<li>Has a Tumblr account.</li>
<li>Says, “I like to party occasionally.” If they have to say it, they know very well what occasionally means.</li>
<li>Is in debt.</li>
<li>Is a Republican. Even if your country of residence does not have a Republican party, this still applies.</li>
<li>Mentions to you, and makes sure everyone knows, that someone has a restraining order against them.</li>
<li>Has a degree in chemistry, and asks if anyone else is using the shed.</li>
<li>Smokes, or if you find any indoor ashtrays.</li>
<li>Mentions “I cook bad food”. That just means “I burn the stove a lot”.</li>
<li>Is the bad kind of racist. “Bad” is the difference between “haha Germans can’t make jokes” and “haha Germans should kill themselves”.</li>
