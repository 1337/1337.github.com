<h1 id="Mechanism"><a href="#Mechanism" class="headerlink" title="Mechanism"></a>Mechanism</h1><p>Django 1.7+ stores migration information in a django_migrations table. The contents look something like</p>
<pre><code>web=# select * from django_migrations;

</code></pre><p>Running <code>./manage.py</code> migrate inserts new entries into the table. Conversely, running ./manage.py migrate app {latest_version - n} removes entries from the table.</p>
<h1 id="manage-py-squashmigrations"><a href="#manage-py-squashmigrations" class="headerlink" title="./manage.py squashmigrations"></a>./manage.py squashmigrations</h1><p>This command takes in a range of migrations from a specific app, combines the operations inside these migrations, and outputs one large migration with a replaces = [migration1, migration2, …] inside. This allows the list of migrations to be replaced by a larger one. Unless operations are cancelled out in migrations 1 to n, squashing migrations does not necessarily speed up the process.</p>
<p>From a series of experiments performed on a large web project, since squashmigrations operates on one app at a time, it does not appear to be effective on projects with many cross-app foreign keys, and unsquashable data migrations in between.</p>
<h1 id="Manually-clearing-migration-history"><a href="#Manually-clearing-migration-history" class="headerlink" title="Manually clearing migration history"></a>Manually clearing migration history</h1><p>There are many questions online about resetting migrations, showing perhaps a need for large projects to reset migrations eventually.</p>
<p>Their procedures are usually as follows:</p>
<ol>
<li>Delete all existing migrations</li>
<li>Fake migrations backward</li>
<li>Create new migrations</li>
<li>Fake migrations forward</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="Make-sure-current-database-state-is-consistent"><a href="#Make-sure-current-database-state-is-consistent" class="headerlink" title="Make sure current database state is consistent"></a>Make sure current database state is consistent</h2><pre><code>./manage.py showmigrations
</code></pre><p>The above command should display a list with all migrations applied.</p>
<h2 id="Fake-migrations-backward"><a href="#Fake-migrations-backward" class="headerlink" title="Fake migrations backward*"></a>Fake migrations backward*</h2><pre><code>./manage.py migrate --fake APP_NAME1 zero
./manage.py migrate --fake APP_NAME3 zero
...
</code></pre><p>This fools Django into believing that the database is fresh. Double check all project apps have no migrations applied, and all third-party apps have all migrations applied, by running ./manage.py showmigrations again.</p>
<p>*This step might be completely necessary, but it should be done to be safe. It is also possible to replace these commands with a more intrusive <code>DELETE FROM django_migrations WHERE app IN (&#39;APP_NAME1&#39;, &#39;APP_NAME2&#39;, ...);</code></p>
<h2 id="Delete-all-existing-migrations"><a href="#Delete-all-existing-migrations" class="headerlink" title="Delete all existing migrations"></a>Delete all existing migrations</h2><p>On a developer machine, delete all migrations in your “migrations” folders that are not <code>__init__.py</code>.</p>
<pre><code>find . -path &quot;*/migrations/*.py&quot; -not -name &quot;__init__.py&quot; -delete
</code></pre><h2 id="Create-new-migrations"><a href="#Create-new-migrations" class="headerlink" title="Create new migrations"></a>Create new migrations</h2><p>Recreate all “effectively missing” migrations by running <code>./manage.py makemigrations</code>.</p>
<p>If this step fails, the schema is too complex to be created in the first place. Consult an elder.</p>
<p>Ensure the new migrations are sane.</p>
<h2 id="Create-data-migrations"><a href="#Create-data-migrations" class="headerlink" title="Create data migrations"></a>Create data migrations</h2><p>Manually (and intelligently), port the data migrations in old migrations to new empty migrations on top of the new auto migrations. Some can be simplified; some are no longer necessary.</p>
<h2 id="Test-your-changes"><a href="#Test-your-changes" class="headerlink" title="Test your changes"></a>Test your changes</h2><p>You now have a new set of auto migrations generated from the schema, and a ported list of data migrations that will be run after the schema is created.</p>
<p>Recreate your database, running all new migrations. The website should run as expected. Tests should pass as expected.</p>
<h1 id="Applying-changes-on-production-other-machines"><a href="#Applying-changes-on-production-other-machines" class="headerlink" title="Applying changes on production / other machines"></a>Applying changes on production / other machines</h1><p>All existing instances of the project must have the latest migrations from develop applied.</p>
<p>Their procedures are usually as follows:</p>
<ol>
<li>Stay on old develop / master</li>
<li>Fake migrations backward</li>
<li>Switch to new develop / master</li>
<li>Fake migrations forward</li>
</ol>
<p>Faking migrations backward while on the old develop / master removes all records of them being applied.</p>
<p>Faking migrations forward while on the new develop / master pretends the new migrations are equivalent to the old ones.</p>
<p>After the operation, the Django project will not be aware of the old migrations. The transition is complete.</p>

<h1 id="Estimation"><a href="#Estimation" class="headerlink" title="Estimation"></a>Estimation</h1><p>Scrum masters organise the backlog with the “correct” point estimation. Too many points (often from management), and the team burns out or fails the sprint. <a href="https://www.mountaingoatsoftware.com/blog/protecting-the-team-cuts-both-ways" target="_blank" rel="external">Too few points</a>, and the team stalls.</p>
<h1 id="Scrum"><a href="#Scrum" class="headerlink" title="Scrum"></a>Scrum</h1><p>The scrum master’s authority is purely on <em>the process</em>, scrum, not the people. The scrum master can optimise the way scrum is run in the team, and ensuring the process is well-adhered. The scrum mastser cannot make team members do specific things.</p>
<h1 id="Improving-the-process"><a href="#Improving-the-process" class="headerlink" title="Improving the process"></a><a href="http://agiletrail.com/2011/11/14/42-tasks-for-a-scrum-masters-job/" target="_blank" rel="external">Improving the process</a></h1><blockquote>

</blockquote>
<p>A overall objective of a scrum master is to make the team work faster; there is otherwise no purpose for this role. To make the team work better, the scrum master:</p>
<ul>
<li>Facilitates meetings, including retrospectives</li>
<li>Coach team members, resolving conflicts or blockers among them<ul>
<li>Code reviews not being done counts as a blocker.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Improve the deployment process</li>
<li>Write and merge/split user stories (DoDs) in the best way they can be done</li>
<li>Understand the big picture by keeping in touch with each stakeholder regularly</li>
<li>Reflect (retrospect) with the team to find better ways to be agile next time.</li>
</ul>
<h1 id="Retrospective"><a href="#Retrospective" class="headerlink" title="Retrospective"></a>Retrospective</h1><p>Improving the process requires the team to know what went wrong before, and to learn from these past mistakes. The scrum master holds retrospectives to</p>
<ul>
<li>Remind the team of agile, scrum values, and their respective roles in scrum</li>
<li>Keep track of success metrics sprint after sprint</li>
<li>Ask open questions</li>
<li>Reflecting issues to the team through observation from outside of the team.</li>

But when you’re out there partying, horsing around, someone out there at the same time is working hard. Someone is getting smarter and someone is winning. Just remember that.”</a> - Arnold Schwarzenegger</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Unfortunately, when you <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=13735610" target="_blank" rel="external">ask a question like that on the Internet</a>, you will get more bad responses than good. Who <em>really</em> wants to read comments, anyway? Startup idea.</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Identify what you actually want in life.</strong><br>If you don’t even know what you want or what goals you have, there is no way you can be motivated to reach it.<blockquote>
<p>“If you really, really want or need something then there’s usually also enough motivation to work towards it.” - rsp1984</p>
</blockquote>
</li>
<li><strong>Make your own startup.</strong><br>If you aren’t afraid of failing, that is. If you really believe in bluetooth tentacle robots, go out there and blow everyone out of the water.</li>
<li><strong>Calm yourself down when stimulation is not appropriate.</strong><br>Learn to switch yourself off every day. This can come in the form of yoga, meditation, or offline reading. Allow yourself to wake up to another day refreshed and ready for anything.</li>
<li><strong>Get a non-tech hobby.</strong><br>Helps you switch off.<blockquote>
<p>“Drawing, painting, knitting, dancing, a sport, volunteering at an animal shelter, gourmet cooking, write a novel, learn a new language.”” - webmaven</p>
</blockquote>
</li>
<li><strong>Keep challenging yourself out of your comfort zone.</strong><br>Once you get used to something, you’ll be good at it, and once you’re good at it, for some reason, you’ll start liking it. Example: self-automation, PHP.</li>
<li><strong>Go on a trip.</strong><br>Trips help you find yourself. Maybe you want to be a scuba diving instructor, not a programmer. Maybe you want to sell designer handbags for a living. Or do social work. Or design fireworks. Or become a priest. Talk to these people, and see what their lives are like.</li>
<li><strong>Take some vitamins.</strong><br>A lack of energy can occasionally be explained by a lack of vitamin D.</li>
<li><strong>Find new work.</strong><br>Maybe your work hours are too long. Or maybe the people you work with are bringing you down. Example: that loser Brian from work who always picks on your use of punctuation.</li>

She kept her ex-husband’s last name because it is more valuable. One day, she decided to write a 300-page book, with the intention to make it an interesting read, rather than writing a handy reference. This is the handy reference.</p>
<h1 id="You-never-really-know-a-company-until-you-own-part-of-it"><a href="#You-never-really-know-a-company-until-you-own-part-of-it" class="headerlink" title="You never really know a company until you own part of it"></a>You never really know a company until you own part of it</h1><blockquote>
<p>“W never [seemed to look] at the stock charts, and thought “<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Efficient-market_hypothesis" target="_blank" rel="external">Efficient Market Theory</a>“ was rubbish. He acted as if the entire stock market didn’t exist, paying attention only to the individual businesses he was interested in owning.” - Actually a rephrased quote</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Other people’s folly, and W’s discipline, are the two key elements of W’s investing philosophy. W invests only when it makes sense from the <em>business perspective</em>. When the market drops, W buys. When the market soars, he stops investing on companies that have no hope for ROI.</p>
<h2 id="Screening-tips"><a href="#Screening-tips" class="headerlink" title="Screening tips"></a>Screening tips</h2><ol>
<li>W buys only when the business is being sold reasonable to its <strong>intrinsic value</strong>, and whether the business will have a high <strong>future value</strong> in 10 years. What are intrinsic value and future value? <em>W only makes long-term investments in companies whose future earnings have a high degree of predictability.</em> This minimises risk. If earnings aren’t predictable, then investing is mere speculation. And W does not do that.</li>
<li>Companies whose earnings can be reasonably predicted are the ones that have good “business economics” working in their favour. They can either buy new businesses to improve their profitability, or improve their existing cash cows. These companies have high <a href="http://www.investopedia.com/terms/r/returnonequity.asp" target="_blank" rel="external">ROE</a>, strong earnings, <strong>consumer monopoly</strong>, and operations that provide shareholder value.<br>1.Buy low, sell only when there is lower “business economics” than when you bought it.</li>
<li>First identify good companies, then wait for the prices to drop. Don’t do it the other way around.</li>
</ol>
<h1 id="Investing-from-a-business-perspective"><a href="#Investing-from-a-business-perspective" class="headerlink" title="Investing from a business perspective"></a>Investing from a business perspective</h1><p>“Investing from a business perspective” teaches you what <em>not</em> to buy.</p>
<p>Signs that you are doing it right:</p>
<ul>
<li>You wait for the market to go down rather than up, using that time to look up companies to own.</li>
<li>You don’t expect (your) stock prices to go up in a week.</li>
<li>Rather than looking at the prices, you learn to invest in companies that give you decent returns in the long term.</li>
<li>You find diversification unnecessary. (Diversification is a means to protect yourself from stupidity, not because you are smart.)</li>
<li>You find cheap stocks expensive, but expensive stocks cheap.</li>
</ul>
<h1 id="Investment-is-most-intelligent-when-it-is-most-businesslike"><a href="#Investment-is-most-intelligent-when-it-is-most-businesslike" class="headerlink" title="Investment is most intelligent when it is most businesslike"></a>Investment is most intelligent when it is most businesslike</h1><p>The numbers are [relatively] useless. You are owning a company; you need to look at the business.</p>
<p>The easiest way to do this (a “buy an excellent business that makes business sense”) is by looking at the long term value of the company, rather than the price of it now. A 100,000-dollar drug store with 20,000-dollar yearly earnings is an annual return of 20%. Then you compare that 20% with other offerings in the same industry, and find the best company to join.</p>
<h1 id="W’s-view-on-earnings"><a href="#W’s-view-on-earnings" class="headerlink" title="W’s view on earnings"></a>W’s view on earnings</h1><ul>
<li>Good companies don’t need to pay dividends if the company reinvesting that money can yield a greater return [on price/value]. Berkshire Hathaway trades at 2xx,000 (right now) and does not give out any dividends.</li>
</ul>
<h1 id="The-price-you-pay-determines-your-rate-of-return"><a href="#The-price-you-pay-determines-your-rate-of-return" class="headerlink" title="The price you pay determines your rate of return"></a>The price you pay determines your rate of return</h1><p>The future value of a stock is $FV = PV \cdot (1 + i)^n$ , where <em>i</em> is your rate of return (usually earnings per share per year), and <em>n</em> is the number of years you hold onto it. So, to determine a good time to buy you stock, just <a href="http://www.investopedia.com/walkthrough/corporate-finance/3/time-value-money/present-value-discounting.aspx" target="_blank" rel="external">reverse the formula</a> and solve for <em>PV</em>.</p>
<p>You will find that <em>i</em> varies year to year, so that’s where the <em>high degree of predictability</em> thing comes in. A high degree of predictability lets you do such a calculation.</p>
<p><strong>Note</strong>: an <em>i</em> of greater than 8% is meaningful. The difference between 14% -&gt; 15% (30% difference over 20 years) is far greater than 13% -&gt; 14% (22% difference over 20 years).</p>
<h1 id="What-to-buy-and-what-price"><a href="#What-to-buy-and-what-price" class="headerlink" title="What to buy, and what price"></a>What to buy, and what price</h1><p>It is never what analysts say. Salesmen never get you a bargain for no reason.</p>
<p>“What to buy, and what price” are the only two things you need to know. <strong>They are independent questions</strong>, but W likes to first look at what he wants to buy, then wait for them to go on sale (Warren), rather than buying whatever is on sale (Graham).</p>
<h1 id="The-magic-of-compounding"><a href="#The-magic-of-compounding" class="headerlink" title="The magic of compounding"></a>The magic of compounding</h1><p>The rate of return <em>needs</em> to be high. A difference between a 15% and 16% is very, very high compounded over 30 years (196,000 dollars of difference, if you start with 10,000 dollars) If you compare 15% with 20%, you get $1,700,000 more. Every single percent counts.</p>
<h1 id="Determining-what-kind-of-business-you-want-to-own"><a href="#Determining-what-kind-of-business-you-want-to-own" class="headerlink" title="Determining what kind of business you want to own"></a>Determining what kind of business you want to own</h1><p><strong>Only invest in business that have superior economics working in their favour, and selling at the right price.</strong> These business must have <em>expanding intrinsic value</em>.</p>
<h1 id="The-theory-of-an-expanding-intrinsic-value"><a href="#The-theory-of-an-expanding-intrinsic-value" class="headerlink" title="The theory of an expanding intrinsic value"></a>The theory of an expanding intrinsic value</h1><p>As a company’s earnings <em>and</em> profitability increase, then its <a href="http://www.money-zine.com/calculators/investment-calculators/intrinsic-value-and-roi-calculator/" target="_blank" rel="external">intrinsic value</a> also rises. IV is however much worth of bonds is required to get the same amount of earnings per share that year. Chapter 34 explains how exactly to calculate intrinsic value.</p>
<p>The company’s IV might eventually be lower than its stock price. If the business has long term revenue, then the stock price will eventually increase to match its IV. Otherwise, it is fine to sell when the IV is lower than its stock price.</p>

<p>“A mediocre business will more than likely remain mediocre” [and have its stock value go nowhere]</p>
</blockquote>
<h1 id="The-mediocre-business"><a href="#The-mediocre-business" class="headerlink" title="The mediocre business"></a>The mediocre business</h1><p>There are two types of business: <em>commodity businesses</em> (paper, gas, oil, textiles, stuff like that) and <em>excellent businesses</em>. Excellent businesses have what W calls <em>consumer monopoly</em>.</p>
<p>Commodity businesses “sell things that a lot of others are selling.” They operate on the principle of low price. They also have erratic year-to-year profits (if any), and rarely provide good returns because of it.</p>
<h1 id="How-to-identify-the-excellent-business"><a href="#How-to-identify-the-excellent-business" class="headerlink" title="How to identify the excellent business"></a>How to identify the excellent business</h1><p>Example: toll bridge. You can’t not pay the toll bridge. Toll bridges are consumer monopolies.<br>Example: towns with only one newspaper. You can’t not advertise on that newspaper (not that good of an example).</p>
<h1 id="Nine-questions-to-help-you-determine-if-a-business-is-truly-an-excellent-one"><a href="#Nine-questions-to-help-you-determine-if-a-business-is-truly-an-excellent-one" class="headerlink" title="Nine questions to help you determine if a business is truly an excellent one"></a>Nine questions to help you determine if a business is truly an excellent one</h1><ol>
<li><strong>Does the business have an identifiable consumer monopoly?</strong><br>For products, this can usually be answered by going to any store, and asking <em>“what brand-name products would the store manager be insane not to carry?”</em></li>
<li><strong>Are the earnings of the company strong and showing an upward trend?</strong><br>Not only should they all be positive, they should be increasing.<br>You can find this information somewhere on the Internet.</li>
<li><strong>Is the company conservatively financed?</strong><br>These companies should have no debt.<br>They should also be out of the commodity sector.</li>
<li><strong>Does the business consistently earn a high rate of return on shareholders’ equity (<a href="http://www.investopedia.com/terms/r/returnonequity.asp" target="_blank" rel="external">ROE</a>)?</strong><br><em>Consistently</em> was italicised.<br>ROE is the “your bang for the buck” factor. It reflects how well the companies use your money to make more money.</li>
<li><strong>Does the business get to retain its earnings?</strong><br>Although it disappoints you as a person, businesses can reinvest any money that isn’t given out as dividends, improving processes or acquiring companies, making it more successful in the long run.</li>
<li><strong>How much does the business have to spend on maintaining current operations?</strong><br>This can often mean the company makes products that rarely go obsolete, and rarely require equipment replacements, high cost of R&amp;D. W’s example was Thompson Publishing, a newspaper company.</li>
<li><strong>Is the company free to reinvest retained earnings in the new business opportunities, expansion of operations, or share repurchases? How good a job does the management do at this?</strong><br>“Look at the management”. The C something Os should be researched.</li>
<li><strong>Is the company free to adjust prices to inflation?</strong><br>The example was airline companies. Even though inflation brought higher costs, the ticket prices had to be kept low to remain competitive. They are not good investment companies.</li>
<li><strong>Will the value added by retained earnings increase the market value of the company?</strong><br>This adds to the compounding effect on returns.</li>
</ol>
<h1 id="Where-to-look-for-excellent-businesses"><a href="#Where-to-look-for-excellent-businesses" class="headerlink" title="Where to look for excellent businesses"></a>Where to look for excellent businesses</h1><ol>
<li><strong>Businesses making products that are used up fast or wear out quickly, have brand name appeal, and that merchants have to keep selling to stay in business</strong><br>This is the toll bridge of products. Merchants need to pay “the toll” to attract customers.<br>Examples: coca cola, pepsi, marlboro. Note that pepsi makes Doritos, and that has brand name appeal.</li>
<li><strong>Businesses that provide a repetitive service manufacturers must use to persuade the public to buy their products</strong><br>This is the toll bridge of doing business.<br>Examples: TV networks, ad agencies.</li>
<li><strong>Businesses that provide repetitive consumer services tht people and businesses are consistently in need of</strong><br>Examples: Pest control, cleaning/maid service, tax services.<br>These companies do not sell products that go obsolete, and do not require much equipment upgrade to stay competitive.</li>
</ol>

These products should be readily needed (and therefore purchased), and should not become obsolete over time.</p>
<p>It is best if you can start from your own field of work.</p>
<p><del>Sometimes you need to phone companies up to get their annual reports. Maybe they don’t trade publicly. That’s fine. Look up their phone number from the package, call them up, give them your address, and they will send you a copy for free.</del></p>
<h2 id="The-scuttlebutt-approach"><a href="#The-scuttlebutt-approach" class="headerlink" title="The scuttlebutt approach"></a>The <em>scuttlebutt approach</em></h2><p>If you don’t know a lot about the company, then Philip Fisher recommends in <em>Common Stocks and Uncommon Profits</em> that you simply call the company’s competition, or customers of the company’s competition, about the company in question. Sort of like having a coffee date with someone’s ex.</p>
<p>You can also ask store <em>managers</em> (no smalltalkers) how some of their products are selling.</p>
<h1 id="What-you-need-to-know-about-the-management-of-the-company-you-may-invest-in"><a href="#What-you-need-to-know-about-the-management-of-the-company-you-may-invest-in" class="headerlink" title="What you need to know about the management of the company you may invest in"></a>What you need to know about the management of the company you may invest in</h1><p>You entrust your money to the management of the business. In order for that to work out for you, either:</p>
<ul>
<li>the management are not idiots; or</li>
<li>the business is so simple that even idiots can run it profitably. (W likes these kinds of businesses)</li>
</ul>
<p>Good managers treat the company like they own it. They act like owners. They are open and honest to shareholders. <em>They <a href="http://www.investopedia.com/articles/02/041702.asp" target="_blank" rel="external">buy back stocks</a> if it makes business sense for them to do so.</em> (It improves figures like ROA and ROE, as well as the stock price.)</p>

Then their stock prices do down, often violently. At this point, if you want to buy/sell, remember that <em>given good management, the company will likely at a better place than what it was before.</em> In that case, buy the dip / just don’t sell.</p>
<h1 id="How-market-mechanics-whipsaw-stock-prices-to-create-buying-opportunities"><a href="#How-market-mechanics-whipsaw-stock-prices-to-create-buying-opportunities" class="headerlink" title="How market mechanics whipsaw stock prices to create buying opportunities"></a>How market mechanics whipsaw stock prices to create buying opportunities</h1><p>When the price goes down, people sell. This makes the price worse. More people sell. There were panics in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Panic_of_1901" target="_blank" rel="external">1901</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_Monday_(1987)" target="_blank" rel="external">1987</a>. This creates opportunities for you to buy.</p>
<h1 id="Inflation"><a href="#Inflation" class="headerlink" title="Inflation"></a>Inflation</h1><p>Paper money used to represent a specific amount of gold, but since that concept went away, governments were free to print however much paper money they want. Thus inflation.</p>
<p>W believes inflation will always continue because deflation is political suicide for anyone who proposes it (think of mortgages. They are fixed payments, which are easier to pay when inflation takes place.)</p>
<h1 id="Inflation-and-consumer-monopoly"><a href="#Inflation-and-consumer-monopoly" class="headerlink" title="Inflation and consumer monopoly"></a>Inflation and consumer monopoly</h1><p>Inflation is generally bad for businesses, but because businesses with consumer monopoly have low operating cost, they generally gain relative competitive edge when, say, inflation doubles the prices of both the costs and products.</p>

To be considered investing, your rate of return must beat both of these combined.</p>

He also believes in concentrated portfolios. For smart people.</p>
<h1 id="When-should-you-sell-your-investments"><a href="#When-should-you-sell-your-investments" class="headerlink" title="When should you sell your investments?"></a>When should you sell your investments?</h1><p>Graham sells when a stock reaches its intrinsic value.<br>Munger, Fisher, and W argued that a good business that keeps on growing should never be sold.</p>
<p>W finds bear and bull markets impossible to predict, so his solution is to ignore it [for his existing investments]. When a bear actually arrived, he bought some Coca-cola.</p>
