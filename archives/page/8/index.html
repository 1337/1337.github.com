She kept her ex-husband’s last name because it is more valuable. One day, she decided to write a 300-page book, with the intention to make it an interesting read, rather than writing a handy reference. This is the handy reference.</p>
<h1 id="You-never-really-know-a-company-until-you-own-part-of-it"><a href="#You-never-really-know-a-company-until-you-own-part-of-it" class="headerlink" title="You never really know a company until you own part of it"></a>You never really know a company until you own part of it</h1><blockquote>
<p>“W never [seemed to look] at the stock charts, and thought “<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Efficient-market_hypothesis" target="_blank" rel="external">Efficient Market Theory</a>“ was rubbish. He acted as if the entire stock market didn’t exist, paying attention only to the individual businesses he was interested in owning.” - Actually a rephrased quote</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Other people’s folly, and W’s discipline, are the two key elements of W’s investing philosophy. W invests only when it makes sense from the <em>business perspective</em>. When the market drops, W buys. When the market soars, he stops investing on companies that have no hope for ROI.</p>
<h2 id="Screening-tips"><a href="#Screening-tips" class="headerlink" title="Screening tips"></a>Screening tips</h2><ol>
<li>W buys only when the business is being sold reasonable to its <strong>intrinsic value</strong>, and whether the business will have a high <strong>future value</strong> in 10 years. What are intrinsic value and future value? <em>W only makes long-term investments in companies whose future earnings have a high degree of predictability.</em> This minimises risk. If earnings aren’t predictable, then investing is mere speculation. And W does not do that.</li>
<li>Companies whose earnings can be reasonably predicted are the ones that have good “business economics” working in their favour. They can either buy new businesses to improve their profitability, or improve their existing cash cows. These companies have high <a href="http://www.investopedia.com/terms/r/returnonequity.asp" target="_blank" rel="external">ROE</a>, strong earnings, <strong>consumer monopoly</strong>, and operations that provide shareholder value.<br>1.Buy low, sell only when there is lower “business economics” than when you bought it.</li>
<li>First identify good companies, then wait for the prices to drop. Don’t do it the other way around.</li>
</ol>
<h1 id="Investing-from-a-business-perspective"><a href="#Investing-from-a-business-perspective" class="headerlink" title="Investing from a business perspective"></a>Investing from a business perspective</h1><p>“Investing from a business perspective” teaches you what <em>not</em> to buy.</p>
<p>Signs that you are doing it right:</p>
<ul>
<li>You wait for the market to go down rather than up, using that time to look up companies to own.</li>
<li>You don’t expect (your) stock prices to go up in a week.</li>
<li>Rather than looking at the prices, you learn to invest in companies that give you decent returns in the long term.</li>
<li>You find diversification unnecessary. (Diversification is a means to protect yourself from stupidity, not because you are smart.)</li>
<li>You find cheap stocks expensive, but expensive stocks cheap.</li>
</ul>
<h1 id="Investment-is-most-intelligent-when-it-is-most-businesslike"><a href="#Investment-is-most-intelligent-when-it-is-most-businesslike" class="headerlink" title="Investment is most intelligent when it is most businesslike"></a>Investment is most intelligent when it is most businesslike</h1><p>The numbers are [relatively] useless. You are owning a company; you need to look at the business.</p>
<p>The easiest way to do this (a “buy an excellent business that makes business sense”) is by looking at the long term value of the company, rather than the price of it now. A 100,000-dollar drug store with 20,000-dollar yearly earnings is an annual return of 20%. Then you compare that 20% with other offerings in the same industry, and find the best company to join.</p>
<h1 id="W’s-view-on-earnings"><a href="#W’s-view-on-earnings" class="headerlink" title="W’s view on earnings"></a>W’s view on earnings</h1><ul>
<li>Good companies don’t need to pay dividends if the company reinvesting that money can yield a greater return [on price/value]. Berkshire Hathaway trades at 2xx,000 (right now) and does not give out any dividends.</li>
</ul>
<h1 id="The-price-you-pay-determines-your-rate-of-return"><a href="#The-price-you-pay-determines-your-rate-of-return" class="headerlink" title="The price you pay determines your rate of return"></a>The price you pay determines your rate of return</h1><p>The future value of a stock is $FV = PV \cdot (1 + i)^n$ , where <em>i</em> is your rate of return (usually earnings per share per year), and <em>n</em> is the number of years you hold onto it. So, to determine a good time to buy you stock, just <a href="http://www.investopedia.com/walkthrough/corporate-finance/3/time-value-money/present-value-discounting.aspx" target="_blank" rel="external">reverse the formula</a> and solve for <em>PV</em>.</p>
<p>You will find that <em>i</em> varies year to year, so that’s where the <em>high degree of predictability</em> thing comes in. A high degree of predictability lets you do such a calculation.</p>
<p><strong>Note</strong>: an <em>i</em> of greater than 8% is meaningful. The difference between 14% -&gt; 15% (30% difference over 20 years) is far greater than 13% -&gt; 14% (22% difference over 20 years).</p>
<h1 id="What-to-buy-and-what-price"><a href="#What-to-buy-and-what-price" class="headerlink" title="What to buy, and what price"></a>What to buy, and what price</h1><p>It is never what analysts say. Salesmen never get you a bargain for no reason.</p>
<p>“What to buy, and what price” are the only two things you need to know. <strong>They are independent questions</strong>, but W likes to first look at what he wants to buy, then wait for them to go on sale (Warren), rather than buying whatever is on sale (Graham).</p>
<h1 id="The-magic-of-compounding"><a href="#The-magic-of-compounding" class="headerlink" title="The magic of compounding"></a>The magic of compounding</h1><p>The rate of return <em>needs</em> to be high. A difference between a 15% and 16% is very, very high compounded over 30 years (196,000 dollars of difference, if you start with 10,000 dollars) If you compare 15% with 20%, you get $1,700,000 more. Every single percent counts.</p>
<h1 id="Determining-what-kind-of-business-you-want-to-own"><a href="#Determining-what-kind-of-business-you-want-to-own" class="headerlink" title="Determining what kind of business you want to own"></a>Determining what kind of business you want to own</h1><p><strong>Only invest in business that have superior economics working in their favour, and selling at the right price.</strong> These business must have <em>expanding intrinsic value</em>.</p>
<h1 id="The-theory-of-an-expanding-intrinsic-value"><a href="#The-theory-of-an-expanding-intrinsic-value" class="headerlink" title="The theory of an expanding intrinsic value"></a>The theory of an expanding intrinsic value</h1><p>As a company’s earnings <em>and</em> profitability increase, then its <a href="http://www.money-zine.com/calculators/investment-calculators/intrinsic-value-and-roi-calculator/" target="_blank" rel="external">intrinsic value</a> also rises. IV is however much worth of bonds is required to get the same amount of earnings per share that year. Chapter 34 explains how exactly to calculate intrinsic value.</p>
<p>The company’s IV might eventually be lower than its stock price. If the business has long term revenue, then the stock price will eventually increase to match its IV. Otherwise, it is fine to sell when the IV is lower than its stock price.</p>

<p>“A mediocre business will more than likely remain mediocre” [and have its stock value go nowhere]</p>
</blockquote>
<h1 id="The-mediocre-business"><a href="#The-mediocre-business" class="headerlink" title="The mediocre business"></a>The mediocre business</h1><p>There are two types of business: <em>commodity businesses</em> (paper, gas, oil, textiles, stuff like that) and <em>excellent businesses</em>. Excellent businesses have what W calls <em>consumer monopoly</em>.</p>
<p>Commodity businesses “sell things that a lot of others are selling.” They operate on the principle of low price. They also have erratic year-to-year profits (if any), and rarely provide good returns because of it.</p>
<h1 id="How-to-identify-the-excellent-business"><a href="#How-to-identify-the-excellent-business" class="headerlink" title="How to identify the excellent business"></a>How to identify the excellent business</h1><p>Example: toll bridge. You can’t not pay the toll bridge. Toll bridges are consumer monopolies.<br>Example: towns with only one newspaper. You can’t not advertise on that newspaper (not that good of an example).</p>
<h1 id="Nine-questions-to-help-you-determine-if-a-business-is-truly-an-excellent-one"><a href="#Nine-questions-to-help-you-determine-if-a-business-is-truly-an-excellent-one" class="headerlink" title="Nine questions to help you determine if a business is truly an excellent one"></a>Nine questions to help you determine if a business is truly an excellent one</h1><ol>
<li><strong>Does the business have an identifiable consumer monopoly?</strong><br>For products, this can usually be answered by going to any store, and asking <em>“what brand-name products would the store manager be insane not to carry?”</em></li>
<li><strong>Are the earnings of the company strong and showing an upward trend?</strong><br>Not only should they all be positive, they should be increasing.<br>You can find this information somewhere on the Internet.</li>
<li><strong>Is the company conservatively financed?</strong><br>These companies should have no debt.<br>They should also be out of the commodity sector.</li>
<li><strong>Does the business consistently earn a high rate of return on shareholders’ equity (<a href="http://www.investopedia.com/terms/r/returnonequity.asp" target="_blank" rel="external">ROE</a>)?</strong><br><em>Consistently</em> was italicised.<br>ROE is the “your bang for the buck” factor. It reflects how well the companies use your money to make more money.</li>
<li><strong>Does the business get to retain its earnings?</strong><br>Although it disappoints you as a person, businesses can reinvest any money that isn’t given out as dividends, improving processes or acquiring companies, making it more successful in the long run.</li>
<li><strong>How much does the business have to spend on maintaining current operations?</strong><br>This can often mean the company makes products that rarely go obsolete, and rarely require equipment replacements, high cost of R&amp;D. W’s example was Thompson Publishing, a newspaper company.</li>
<li><strong>Is the company free to reinvest retained earnings in the new business opportunities, expansion of operations, or share repurchases? How good a job does the management do at this?</strong><br>“Look at the management”. The C something Os should be researched.</li>
<li><strong>Is the company free to adjust prices to inflation?</strong><br>The example was airline companies. Even though inflation brought higher costs, the ticket prices had to be kept low to remain competitive. They are not good investment companies.</li>
<li><strong>Will the value added by retained earnings increase the market value of the company?</strong><br>This adds to the compounding effect on returns.</li>
</ol>
<h1 id="Where-to-look-for-excellent-businesses"><a href="#Where-to-look-for-excellent-businesses" class="headerlink" title="Where to look for excellent businesses"></a>Where to look for excellent businesses</h1><ol>
<li><strong>Businesses making products that are used up fast or wear out quickly, have brand name appeal, and that merchants have to keep selling to stay in business</strong><br>This is the toll bridge of products. Merchants need to pay “the toll” to attract customers.<br>Examples: coca cola, pepsi, marlboro. Note that pepsi makes Doritos, and that has brand name appeal.</li>
<li><strong>Businesses that provide a repetitive service manufacturers must use to persuade the public to buy their products</strong><br>This is the toll bridge of doing business.<br>Examples: TV networks, ad agencies.</li>
<li><strong>Businesses that provide repetitive consumer services tht people and businesses are consistently in need of</strong><br>Examples: Pest control, cleaning/maid service, tax services.<br>These companies do not sell products that go obsolete, and do not require much equipment upgrade to stay competitive.</li>
</ol>

These products should be readily needed (and therefore purchased), and should not become obsolete over time.</p>
<p>It is best if you can start from your own field of work.</p>
<p><del>Sometimes you need to phone companies up to get their annual reports. Maybe they don’t trade publicly. That’s fine. Look up their phone number from the package, call them up, give them your address, and they will send you a copy for free.</del></p>
<h2 id="The-scuttlebutt-approach"><a href="#The-scuttlebutt-approach" class="headerlink" title="The scuttlebutt approach"></a>The <em>scuttlebutt approach</em></h2><p>If you don’t know a lot about the company, then Philip Fisher recommends in <em>Common Stocks and Uncommon Profits</em> that you simply call the company’s competition, or customers of the company’s competition, about the company in question. Sort of like having a coffee date with someone’s ex.</p>
<p>You can also ask store <em>managers</em> (no smalltalkers) how some of their products are selling.</p>
<h1 id="What-you-need-to-know-about-the-management-of-the-company-you-may-invest-in"><a href="#What-you-need-to-know-about-the-management-of-the-company-you-may-invest-in" class="headerlink" title="What you need to know about the management of the company you may invest in"></a>What you need to know about the management of the company you may invest in</h1><p>You entrust your money to the management of the business. In order for that to work out for you, either:</p>
<ul>
<li>the management are not idiots; or</li>
<li>the business is so simple that even idiots can run it profitably. (W likes these kinds of businesses)</li>
</ul>
<p>Good managers treat the company like they own it. They act like owners. They are open and honest to shareholders. <em>They <a href="http://www.investopedia.com/articles/02/041702.asp" target="_blank" rel="external">buy back stocks</a> if it makes business sense for them to do so.</em> (It improves figures like ROA and ROE, as well as the stock price.)</p>

Then their stock prices do down, often violently. At this point, if you want to buy/sell, remember that <em>given good management, the company will likely at a better place than what it was before.</em> In that case, buy the dip / just don’t sell.</p>
<h1 id="How-market-mechanics-whipsaw-stock-prices-to-create-buying-opportunities"><a href="#How-market-mechanics-whipsaw-stock-prices-to-create-buying-opportunities" class="headerlink" title="How market mechanics whipsaw stock prices to create buying opportunities"></a>How market mechanics whipsaw stock prices to create buying opportunities</h1><p>When the price goes down, people sell. This makes the price worse. More people sell. There were panics in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Panic_of_1901" target="_blank" rel="external">1901</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_Monday_(1987)" target="_blank" rel="external">1987</a>. This creates opportunities for you to buy.</p>
<h1 id="Inflation"><a href="#Inflation" class="headerlink" title="Inflation"></a>Inflation</h1><p>Paper money used to represent a specific amount of gold, but since that concept went away, governments were free to print however much paper money they want. Thus inflation.</p>
<p>W believes inflation will always continue because deflation is political suicide for anyone who proposes it (think of mortgages. They are fixed payments, which are easier to pay when inflation takes place.)</p>
<h1 id="Inflation-and-consumer-monopoly"><a href="#Inflation-and-consumer-monopoly" class="headerlink" title="Inflation and consumer monopoly"></a>Inflation and consumer monopoly</h1><p>Inflation is generally bad for businesses, but because businesses with consumer monopoly have low operating cost, they generally gain relative competitive edge when, say, inflation doubles the prices of both the costs and products.</p>

To be considered investing, your rate of return must beat both of these combined.</p>

He also believes in concentrated portfolios. For smart people.</p>

<p>W finds bear and bull markets impossible to predict, so his solution is to ignore it [for his existing investments]. When a bear actually arrived, he bought some Coca-cola.</p>

    	<p>Unless you are me, I have taken the liberty to read and summarise it for you.</p>
<h1 id="The-four-basic-principles-CRAP"><a href="#The-four-basic-principles-CRAP" class="headerlink" title="The four basic principles, CRAP"></a>The four basic principles, <strong>CRAP</strong></h1><ol>
<li><strong>Contrast</strong><br>If some elements on the page are meant to be different, make them look different.</li>
<li><strong>Repetition</strong><br>Repeat visual cues like colours, shapes, textures, fonts, and sizes. This helps the user recognise patterns.</li>
<li><strong>Alignment</strong><br>Nothing should be placed arbitrarily. Every element should have some visual connection with another element on the same page.</li>
<li><strong>Proximity</strong><br>Related things should be put together. This reduces clutter.</li>
</ol>
<h1 id="Proximity"><a href="#Proximity" class="headerlink" title="Proximity"></a>Proximity</h1><p>Proximity implies a relationship.  <strong>Limit yourself to 3 to 5 visual elements on a page.</strong></p>
<p>You write address lines one after another because the lines are related—a single unit of logic. You don’t write your address in all four corners on an envelope.</p>
<p>If anything you design come in sections (such as menus), make sure the section headers are the same style, which is a different style from the sub menu items. <em>This is one of the strong points for vertical menus on multi-section websites.</em></p>
<p>Make sure your paragraph headings are closer to the paragraph than the paragraph before it, i.e.</p>
<pre><code>Title
Paragraph.

Title
Paragraph.
</code></pre><h1 id="Alignment"><a href="#Alignment" class="headerlink" title="Alignment"></a>Alignment</h1><p>Centering everything on a page can look rather dull. <strong>If you are going to center text, make it obvious.</strong></p>
<p>Never center body text. It is usually best to align left headings with left body text, which is coincidentally the default. A big no-no is centered headings with indented paragraphs.</p>
<p>Nothing should be placed arbitrarily. On a multi-element page, an element should have at least one edge aligned with some other element. An example of this may be left-aligning the first column of a table, while right-aligning the last column. A simple way to make sure is <strong>Reusing edges on existing page elements</strong>.</p>
<h1 id="Repetition"><a href="#Repetition" class="headerlink" title="Repetition"></a>Repetition</h1><p>If you are designing a book, at least make a common header and footer across all pages.<br><strong>Use the same navigation elements for all of your pages on the same site.</strong> This also applies to the entire company: <strong>stick to a single design.</strong> If there isn’t a single design, write a guideline. Don’t all invent their own logos and headings and paragraph fonts. Don’t make a different site theme for each department.</p>
<p>Once you use a bold typeface for an element, stick to the same bold typeface.</p>
<h1 id="Contrast"><a href="#Contrast" class="headerlink" title="Contrast"></a>Contrast</h1><blockquote>
<p><strong>Don’t be a wimp.</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p>If two items are not exactly the same, then make one of them really different.<br>Make sure your headings stand out from paragraph text, and make sure your paragraphs don’t separate themselves with contrast for some reason. Remember, having no contrast is the default, and you must have messed it up yourself to make it terrible.</p>
<p>Determine where you want the focus to be (on a page), then put the focus there. Lower focus everywhere else. If you are making a resume, the focus is often your name, but<br>it does not have to be the case. If you are making a lost dog poster, your focus<br>had better be <strong>LOST DOG</strong>, rather than Woofie.</p>
<h1 id="Website-specific-tips"><a href="#Website-specific-tips" class="headerlink" title="Website-specific tips"></a>Website-specific tips</h1><p>Don’t make your users scroll to see the navigation, man.<br>Keep your text contrast high, and keep your paragraphs short. No one came to read your intro; they came to get information.</p>

<p>$$<br>Al + O_2 \to Al_2O_3<br>$$</p>
<p>Look at the Al on both sides. There is one on the left and two on the right. In order to balance Al, maybe we can multiply the Al on the left by 2:</p>
<p>$$<br>2Al + O_2 \to Al_2O_3<br>$$</p>
<p>Of course now there are 2 oxygens on the left and 3 on the right. The formula is still not balanced. We can multiply the oxygen on the left by 1.5:</p>
<p>$$<br>2Al + 1.5 O_2 \to Al_2O_3<br>$$</p>
<p>To remove the bizarre 1.5, multiply all components on both sides until they are all integers, in this case being 2:</p>
<p>$$<br>4Al + 3 O_2 \to 2Al_2O_3<br>$$</p>
<p>Done!</p>
<h1 id="Slightly-more-complex-chemical-equations"><a href="#Slightly-more-complex-chemical-equations" class="headerlink" title="Slightly more complex chemical equations"></a><a href="https://www.khanacademy.org/science/chemistry/chemical-reactions-stoichiome/balancing-chemical-equations/v/balancing-more-complex-chemical-equation" target="_blank" rel="external">Slightly more complex chemical equations</a></h1><p>Now you have a more complex equation consisting of compounds on all sides:</p>
<p>$$<br>C_2H_4 + O_2 \to CO_2 + H_2O<br>$$</p>
<p>As a trick, it is better to first balance the compound with the highest molecular weight, in this case being $C_2H_4$:</p>
<p>$$<br>C_2H_4 + O_2 \to 2CO_2 + H_2O<br>$$</p>
<p>Now you can balance the hydrogen in the same (most complex) molecule. Balance the hydrogens:</p>
<p>$$<br>C_2H_4 + O_2 \to 2CO_2 + 2H_2O<br>$$</p>
<p>Now only the oxygens should be imbalanced. Do so appropriately.</p>
<p>$$<br>C_2H_4 + 2O_2 \to 2CO_2 + 2H_2O<br>$$</p>
<p>Done!</p>
<h1 id="Balance-Redox-reactions"><a href="#Balance-Redox-reactions" class="headerlink" title="Balance Redox reactions"></a><a href="https://www.khanacademy.org/science/chemistry/oxidation-reduction/redox-oxidation-reduction/v/balance-and-redox-reactions1" target="_blank" rel="external">Balance Redox reactions</a></h1><p>Redox reactions involve the movement of electrons. They must be balanced in addition to the elements. We need to know what oxidation states all the elements are in.</p>
<p>Given this example redox reaction:</p>
<p>$$<br>Cr_2O_7^{2-} + Cl^- \to Cr^{3+} + Cl_2<br>$$</p>
<p>In $Cr_2O_7^{2-}$, oxygen is normally -2 (unless it is reacting with a more electronegative element for some reason), which means the oxygens in that compound have a total charge of -14. However the overall charge of the compound is -2, so the chromiums must be +12/2 = +6 each.</p>
<p>Knowing Cr on the left is +6, but Cr on the right is +3, we know it is being reduced.<br>Seeing Cl being -1 on the left and +0 on the right, we know it is being oxidised.</p>
<p>Write down the two <em>half equations</em>, also interpreted as <em>half cells</em> in some situations:</p>
<span>$$Cr_2O_7^{2-} + \cdots \to Cr^{3+} + \cdots \\
Cl^- + \cdots \to Cl_2 + \cdots$$</span><!-- Has MathJax -->
<p>Balance all atoms other than hydrogen and oxygen, because either redox reactions are typically aqueous, or you are just told it is. If the reaction is not in water, you cannot do the next 3 steps.</p>
<span>$$Cr_2O_7^{2-} + \cdots \to 2Cr^{3+} + \cdots \\
2Cl^- + \cdots \to Cl_2 + \cdots$$</span><!-- Has MathJax -->
<p>Then balance the oxygens by adding $H_2O$ on either sides:</p>
<span>$$Cr_2O_7^{2-} + \cdots \to 2Cr^{3+} + 7H_2O + \cdots \\
2Cl^- + \cdots \to Cl_2 + \cdots$$</span><!-- Has MathJax -->
<p>Then balance the hydrogens by adding protons.</p>
<span>$$Cr_2O_7^{2-} + 14H^+ \to 2Cr^{3+} + 7H_2O \\
2Cl^- \to Cl_2 + \cdots$$</span><!-- Has MathJax -->
<p>Balance the charges (not electrons) in the half reactions by adding electrons.</p>
<span>$$Cr_2O_7^{2-} + 14H^+ + 6e^- \to 2Cr^{3+} + 7H_2O \\
2Cl^- \to Cl_2 + 2e^-$$</span><!-- Has MathJax -->
<p>Balance the electrons in both <em>sides</em>. In this case, the left side has a charge of +12, and the right hand side has a charge of +6. Add six electrons to the right.</p>
<p>Finally, make the number of electrons equal. There are 6 in the first reaction but only 2 in the second, so let’s multiply the second reaction by 3.</p>
<span>$$Cr_2O_7^{2-} + 14H^+ + 6e^- \to 2Cr^{3+} + 7H_2O \\
6Cl^- \to 3Cl_2 + 6e^-$$</span><!-- Has MathJax -->
<p>Both sides are balanced. You can now merge the two sides.</p>
<p>$$<br>Cr_2O_7^{2-} + 6Cl^- + 14H^+ \to 2Cr^{3+} + 3Cl_2 + 7H_2O<br>$$</p>
<p>Done!</p>

    	<p>The <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xDuwrtwYHu8&amp;app=desktop" target="_blank" rel="external"><strong>Saga Pattern</strong></a> is a failure management pattern. </p>
<p>A <strong>saga</strong> is a long-lived transaction that can be written as sub-transactions. Each sub-transaction cannot take data from one another.</p>
<p>Each <strong>sub-transaction</strong> <em>T</em> has an idempotent “compensating transaction” <em>C</em>, that semantically undoes <em>T</em>. If <em>T</em> were sending an email, then <em>C</em> is a follow up email saying sorry.</p>
<p>The <strong>Saga Guarantee</strong> is</p>
<ul>
<li>Either <em>T1</em>, <em>T2</em>, …, Tn all complete, or</li>
<li><em>T1, T2, …, Tn</em>, <em>Cn, …, C2, C1</em> all complete.</li>
</ul>
<p>Implementing Saga in a distributed system relies on a component called the <strong>Saga execution coordinator (SEC)</strong>. The SEC makes sure <em>Cn</em> is executed:</p>
<ul>
<li>if <em>Tn</em> fails</li>
<li>if the Saga is aborted by some other <em>T</em>, or</li>
<li>if SEC fails. In this case, the restarted SEC runs <em>C</em> for any <em>T</em> in the Saga Log with a missing “end transaction” entry, then aborts the saga.</li>
</ul>
<p>The <strong>Saga Log</strong> records what sub-transactions the SEC did in a Saga.<br>All sub-transactions are logged with Start and ends. See above for why it is done.</p>
<p>In distributed systems, “transactions” don’t exist, so T1, T2, …, Tn become Requests instead.</p>
<p>If <strong>Forward recovery</strong> (aka retrying) is desirable, then you need to make sure the act of retrying (i.e. <em>T</em>) is idempotent. At this point, you have essentially made an operation that can be started and stopped at any point, which can be delivered to multiple distributed services and succeed/fail independently.</p>
