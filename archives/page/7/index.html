    	<p>The <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xDuwrtwYHu8&amp;app=desktop" target="_blank" rel="external"><strong>Saga Pattern</strong></a> is a failure management pattern. </p>
<p>A <strong>saga</strong> is a long-lived transaction that can be written as sub-transactions. Each sub-transaction cannot take data from one another.</p>
<p>Each <strong>sub-transaction</strong> <em>T</em> has an idempotent “compensating transaction” <em>C</em>, that semantically undoes <em>T</em>. If <em>T</em> were sending an email, then <em>C</em> is a follow up email saying sorry.</p>
<p>The <strong>Saga Guarantee</strong> is</p>
<ul>
<li>Either <em>T1</em>, <em>T2</em>, …, Tn all complete, or</li>
<li><em>T1, T2, …, Tn</em>, <em>Cn, …, C2, C1</em> all complete.</li>
</ul>
<p>Implementing Saga in a distributed system relies on a component called the <strong>Saga execution coordinator (SEC)</strong>. The SEC makes sure <em>Cn</em> is executed:</p>
<ul>
<li>if <em>Tn</em> fails</li>
<li>if the Saga is aborted by some other <em>T</em>, or</li>
<li>if SEC fails. In this case, the restarted SEC runs <em>C</em> for any <em>T</em> in the Saga Log with a missing “end transaction” entry, then aborts the saga.</li>
</ul>
<p>The <strong>Saga Log</strong> records what sub-transactions the SEC did in a Saga.<br>All sub-transactions are logged with Start and ends. See above for why it is done.</p>
<p>In distributed systems, “transactions” don’t exist, so T1, T2, …, Tn become Requests instead.</p>
<p>If <strong>Forward recovery</strong> (aka retrying) is desirable, then you need to make sure the act of retrying (i.e. <em>T</em>) is idempotent. At this point, you have essentially made an operation that can be started and stopped at any point, which can be delivered to multiple distributed services and succeed/fail independently.</p>

    	<p>(Title ripped directly from <a href="https://theshoregriefcenter.wordpress.com/2014/01/15/10-things-crutches-have-taught-me/" target="_blank" rel="external">this post</a>.)</p>
<p>I went skiing last Christmas, and the mountains had claimed my knee (<a href="http://orthoinfo.aaos.org/topic.cfm?topic=a00549" target="_blank" rel="external">some ligaments don’t grow back by themselves</a>, apparently). A group of wonderful friends endured the ordeal with me, an experience I will never forget (medal winners were Jill, Joel, Sultan, and Thomas; special mentions go to family and the government.)</p>
<p>Knee’s useless now. Crutches are in order. Got a pair from the hospital. The last two days were the most physically challenging time of my life.</p>
<h2 id="You-don’t-have-two-arms-when-you-have-two-legs"><a href="#You-don’t-have-two-arms-when-you-have-two-legs" class="headerlink" title="You don’t have two arms when you have two legs"></a>You don’t have two arms when you have two legs</h2><p>Want to walk? Use crutches. How are you using the crutches? With both hands. What can you do while both hands are occupied? Nothing. Even the simplest things can be near impossible to do:</p>
<ul>
<li>Carrying a glass of water to another room</li>
<li>Carrying a plate of food</li>
<li>Carrying anything requiring hands up/down the stairs</li>
<li>Entering a shower</li>
<li>Standing in a shower</li>
<li>Showering</li>
<li>Putting on socks</li>
<li>Wiping (who’s going to help you now?)</li>
</ul>
<p>So, in a sense, by losing a knee, you lose three limbs. Very interesting experience indeed.</p>
<h2 id="People-will-help-you"><a href="#People-will-help-you" class="headerlink" title="People will help you"></a>People will help you</h2><p>And you should accept their offers. No more self reliance and I-can-do-everything attitude, because now you genuinely need the help. Maybe you need a stool. Maybe you need a pillow. Maybe you cannot find your crutches. Maybe you need help getting into a car. Remember you are no longer the person you were, but you are not useless just yet. <em>Accept the help.</em></p>
<h2 id="People-around-you-will-suddenly-be-more-aware-of-accessibility"><a href="#People-around-you-will-suddenly-be-more-aware-of-accessibility" class="headerlink" title="People around you will suddenly be more aware of accessibility"></a>People around you will suddenly be more aware of accessibility</h2><p>Which is a good thing. Not until now had I thought those automatic door buttons being extremely slow being brilliant design. If they opened any faster, you wouldn’t be able to dodge the swinging doors.</p>
<h2 id="They-will-mistake-crutches-for-canes"><a href="#They-will-mistake-crutches-for-canes" class="headerlink" title="They will mistake crutches for canes"></a>They will mistake crutches for canes</h2><p>Sometimes you simply cannot walk with just one crutch, as is the case when the bad leg cannot bear any load.<br>Canes are for people with two functional (but weak) legs. If you take a crutch from me, I can only hop on my good leg.</p>
<h2 id="You-are-not-alone-there-are-many-people-just-like-you"><a href="#You-are-not-alone-there-are-many-people-just-like-you" class="headerlink" title="You are not alone; there are many people just like you"></a>You are not alone; there are many people just like you</h2><p>And because of that, outside your own place of dwelling, it is actually not that bad. Any form of official building would have a code that requires a level of accessibility to be taken into account. You legitimately qualify for the handicap (“people who identify with disability”, according to Ryerson’s Ted Rogers School of Management) washrooms now. You can use the lift/elevator for one single floor, without being perceived as a douche. I have not tried this yet, but shopping malls have scooters that are designed for people like us/you, and/or the morbidly obese.</p>
<h2 id="Healing-takes-a-long-time"><a href="#Healing-takes-a-long-time" class="headerlink" title="Healing takes a long time"></a>Healing takes a <em>long</em> time</h2><p>And you should not rush it. Trying to bend the knee will make it worse (in my case, anyway). Trying to stand on the bad leg will also make it worse, often permanently. There is no need to rush it recovery, because it is happening as quickly as you let it.</p>
<h2 id="You-can-use-the-crutch-like-a-stick"><a href="#You-can-use-the-crutch-like-a-stick" class="headerlink" title="You can use the crutch like a stick"></a><em>You</em> can use the crutch like a stick</h2><p>Unlike normal people using a crutch like a stick, <em>you</em> using the crutch like a stick is seen as an advantage; a clever idea. People with legs poking light switches from their seats is just being lazy.</p>
<h2 id="Exercise-whenever-you-can"><a href="#Exercise-whenever-you-can" class="headerlink" title="Exercise whenever you can"></a>Exercise whenever you can</h2><p>Muscle loss will occur immediately after the injury. Consult with a physiotherapist to see what kinds of exercise you can do, and how often you can do them.</p>
<h2 id="Don’t-go-to-work"><a href="#Don’t-go-to-work" class="headerlink" title="Don’t go to work"></a>Don’t go to work</h2><p>What are you, insane? Going to work not only increases the chances of you hurting yourself, you will also delay healing by inducing additional stress (pointed out by a mate who goes by “YS”.) If you can work from home, then you don’t need to move. Win. If you cannot work from home, then the company cannot fire you for not working (but they can do so for other reasons). Also win.</p>
<h2 id="“It-only-gets-better-from-here”-is-not-true"><a href="#“It-only-gets-better-from-here”-is-not-true" class="headerlink" title="“It only gets better from here” is not true"></a>“It only gets better from here” is not true</h2><p>Just because an injury is acute, but it doesn’t mean things will only get better. For example, an injury to the knee significantly increases the chance of that same knee developing arthritis, especially so for the case if you try to use the bad knee before it fully recovers. <em>If you don’t take good care of yourself, no one will.</em></p>

    	<p>I believe everyone should learn something every day. Here is what I learned every so often.</p>
<h1 id="Working-with-yourself"><a href="#Working-with-yourself" class="headerlink" title="Working with yourself"></a>Working with yourself</h1><h2 id="Keep-a-journal"><a href="#Keep-a-journal" class="headerlink" title="Keep a journal"></a>Keep a journal</h2><p>Chances are, you won’t remember everything.<br>Keep a journal. For work. For home. For your personal life (sometimes known as a diary).<br>Write down what you did that day, and what you learned that day.<br>Not only does that help you remember everything, it helps you hold yourself accountable, too.</p>
<h2 id="Remember-what-people-said"><a href="#Remember-what-people-said" class="headerlink" title="Remember what people said"></a>Remember what people said</h2><p>People tell you things all the time. Then they expect you to remember everything.<br>Chances are, you won’t remember everything.<br>What down what people say. Later, you can find out why something was done this way or not this way, and hold them accountable, too.</p>
<h2 id="Know-what-people-do-in-the-company"><a href="#Know-what-people-do-in-the-company" class="headerlink" title="Know what people do in the company"></a>Know what people do in the company</h2><p>It will eventually come to you that not everyone in your company is a developer, and they all do different things. They all <em>want</em> different things out of their jobs, and they have different objectives to what they do.<br>You should observe what they do, know the things they pay close attention to, and learn from them.</p>
<h2 id="Memorise-the-org-chart"><a href="#Memorise-the-org-chart" class="headerlink" title="Memorise the org chart"></a>Memorise the org chart</h2><p>It is rarely wise to let others tell you what to do, when they aren’t in your department.<br>This is less important in a startup, of course, but remember, no one budgeted your sprint time for other departments’ activities.<br>Likewise (37), if someone higher up messages you directly, there is no hard requirement for you to respond directly, either (though you should).</p>
<h2 id="There’s-no-point-if-you-aren’t-the-best"><a href="#There’s-no-point-if-you-aren’t-the-best" class="headerlink" title="There’s no point if you aren’t the best"></a>There’s no point if you aren’t the best</h2><p>No one hired you to be mediocre. Therefore, only only must you be the best, you must be <em>your</em> best.</p>
<h2 id="Log-your-sick-and-vacation-days"><a href="#Log-your-sick-and-vacation-days" class="headerlink" title="Log your sick (and vacation) days"></a>Log your sick (and vacation) days</h2><p>Everyone should be keeping track of themselves.<br>Eliminate the means of your company screwing you over on paid days off.</p>
<h2 id="Make-friends"><a href="#Make-friends" class="headerlink" title="Make friends"></a>Make friends</h2><p>On a personal level, you will want to build relationships with the people who work with you.<br>A happy colleague is a happy you.</p>
<h2 id="If-it-isn’t-difficult-it-isn’t-worth-doing"><a href="#If-it-isn’t-difficult-it-isn’t-worth-doing" class="headerlink" title="If it isn’t difficult, it isn’t worth doing"></a>If it isn’t difficult, it isn’t worth doing</h2><p>You learn only by challenging yourselves. Being an accountant for a decade doesn’t make you better at making spreadsheets than one who’s fresh out of college.<br>Use your time wisely. When it comes to problem selection, choose the hard ones.</p>
<h2 id="Leave-your-comfort-zone"><a href="#Leave-your-comfort-zone" class="headerlink" title="Leave your comfort zone"></a>Leave your comfort zone</h2><p>Work on other projects. <a href="/2016/How-to-learn-how-to-learn/">Start small. The most important thing is to start, and don’t give up until you finish.</a></p>
<h2 id="Help-out"><a href="#Help-out" class="headerlink" title="Help out"></a>Help out</h2><p>When people need help, that means the problem is either hard (in which you can learn), or easy (for which you earn respect.) It’s a win-win.<br>(Or they’re trying to waste your time with mundane things. Need to watch out for that.)</p>
<h2 id="Expand-your-horizons"><a href="#Expand-your-horizons" class="headerlink" title="Expand your horizons"></a>Expand your horizons</h2><p>The world doesn’t just do what you do; go out there and learn some stuff. If you know C++, learn Java.</p>
<h2 id="Excel-in-your-territory"><a href="#Excel-in-your-territory" class="headerlink" title="Excel in your territory"></a>Excel in your territory</h2><p>“Be good at what you do” should be your baseline.<br>“Be the best at what you do” should be your benchmark.<br>“Be the best at what everyone else does” should be your life goal.</p>
<h2 id="If-you-don’t-know-something-ask"><a href="#If-you-don’t-know-something-ask" class="headerlink" title="If you don’t know something, ask"></a>If you don’t know something, ask</h2><p>Asking questions almost always means you get a better idea at something, especially outside your area of expertise.<br>Also, asking questions, much like a favour, makes people like you. This is a form of social engineering.</p>
<h2 id="Don’t-wait-until-something-becomes-a-problem"><a href="#Don’t-wait-until-something-becomes-a-problem" class="headerlink" title="Don’t wait until something becomes a problem"></a>Don’t wait until something becomes a problem</h2><p>Whatever you built inevitably has bugs (unless you did write 10000 tests for every line of code, which is not unheard of.) Some bugs are merged with the expectation that they are never considered a use case for the feature.<br>If you have time, close those holes. You don’t want someone to hack you one day.</p>
<h2 id="Don’t-let-production-users-find-your-bugs-15"><a href="#Don’t-let-production-users-find-your-bugs-15" class="headerlink" title="Don’t let production users find your bugs (15)"></a>Don’t let production users find your bugs (15)</h2><p>Knowingly pushing buggy code, knowing there is a deadline, should not be part of your work culture.<br>Once you show your users buggy code, there is no way to undo that mistake.</p>
<p><strong>Counter argument</strong>: “If a flag can get it done let’s get it done. Launching is the best way to find problems to fix” (29)</p>
<h2 id="Be-ready-to-fix-things-on-production-42"><a href="#Be-ready-to-fix-things-on-production-42" class="headerlink" title="Be ready to fix things on production (42)"></a>Be ready to fix things on production (42)</h2><p>Production services should never have errors. One advantage of being in an error-free state is the error emails that you (must set up, and) receive will be actual errors that you must fix, so you don’t simply filter them away.</p>
<h2 id="Implement-to-the-spec-17"><a href="#Implement-to-the-spec-17" class="headerlink" title="Implement to the spec (17)"></a>Implement to the spec (17)</h2><p>Once a spec is done, whatever is within the spec, you do exactly what the spec says. <em>The only parts within your control is that which is not written down.</em></p>
<h2 id="“If-you-are-given-your-own-job-would-you-take-it-”"><a href="#“If-you-are-given-your-own-job-would-you-take-it-”" class="headerlink" title="“If you are given your own job, would you take it?”"></a>“If you are given your own job, would you take it?”</h2><p>To do a good job, you must like what you do. If you are offered your own job right now, and you don’t want to take it, then you are probably both in a bad job, and doing a bad job.</p>
<h1 id="Working-with-code"><a href="#Working-with-code" class="headerlink" title="Working with code"></a>Working with code</h1><h2 id="Write-tests"><a href="#Write-tests" class="headerlink" title="Write tests"></a>Write tests</h2><p>Tests can sometimes save you back more time than the time you spend writing them.<br>Well, depends on how the code was written, anyway. More about testable code later.</p>
<h2 id="Make-small-tasks-for-yourself-2"><a href="#Make-small-tasks-for-yourself-2" class="headerlink" title="Make small tasks for yourself (2)"></a>Make small tasks for yourself (2)</h2><p>Break your tasks into smaller, understandable pieces.</p>
<p>Someone might come to you and say, “build me this.”<br>When “this” is a huge endeavour, you will be overwhelmed by the requirements and deadline planning. You don’t actually know what “this” entails.</p>
<h2 id="Make-a-feature-branch-if-the-task-is-big-47"><a href="#Make-a-feature-branch-if-the-task-is-big-47" class="headerlink" title="Make a feature branch if the task is big (47)"></a>Make a feature branch if the task is big (47)</h2><p>A task can be so large that requires collaboration among developers in near real time.<br>In that case, it is probably better to work on a branch, pushing directly to it, and submit the final product for review, rather than submitting each individual change, which the QA must test one by one.</p>
<h2 id="Tests-will-fail"><a href="#Tests-will-fail" class="headerlink" title="Tests will fail"></a>Tests will fail</h2><p>And not only will they fail, they will be hard to fix. The 1/100/10000 rule states that for every second of code you write, you will spend 100 seconds writing tests, and 10000 more wondering why they don’t all pass. </p>
<h2 id="Make-small-changes"><a href="#Make-small-changes" class="headerlink" title="Make small changes"></a>Make small changes</h2><p>No one wants to read big changes. No one wants to test big changes.<br>When you make a big change, QA will ignore you until all other changes are merged.<br>So then you’ll have to rebase.<br>And get code reviews done, all over again.<br>Make small changes.</p>
<h2 id="Other-people’s-tech-debt-are-yours…"><a href="#Other-people’s-tech-debt-are-yours…" class="headerlink" title="Other people’s tech debt are yours…"></a>Other people’s tech debt are yours…</h2><p>If my experience is anything to go by, then I can say for certain that only you will care about technical debt.<br>Overestimate your stories so you get time to recover from the chronic debt.</p>
<p>If you happen to be a project lead, the tech debt you <em>allow</em> into your code base become yours, too. Make careful decisions before you approve or disapprove a change (45).</p>
<h2 id="…And-tech-debt-can-kill-you"><a href="#…And-tech-debt-can-kill-you" class="headerlink" title="…And tech debt can kill you"></a>…And tech debt can kill you</h2><p>After a lot of technical debt, you will start to develop mental issues. You will burn out and require actual medical care.<br>Do not ignore burnout! Take care of yourself first. Work isn’t everything.</p>
<h2 id="Users-are-stupid"><a href="#Users-are-stupid" class="headerlink" title="Users are stupid"></a>Users are stupid</h2><p>And they always, always overestimate their intelligence. There is an art to implementing unassuming UX, and you have not mastered it yet.</p>
<h2 id="Write-your-own-integration-tests"><a href="#Write-your-own-integration-tests" class="headerlink" title="Write your own integration tests"></a>Write your own integration tests</h2><p>If something breaks across components, the blame will simply be placed on you. To avoid things like that, cover yourself with some more tests.<br>No one (here) has ever said no to more tests.</p>
<h2 id="Your-code-represents-you"><a href="#Your-code-represents-you" class="headerlink" title="Your code represents you"></a>Your code represents you</h2><p>Make sure you like the looks of something before you push it out to the world. If you do a crappy job of designing an interface, your users will think</p>
<p>1) your product is a joke,<br>1) your company is a joke, and<br>1) you are a joke.</p>
<p>One or more of these may concern you. “Don’t feel pressured to push something you’re not happy with.” (30)</p>

<h2 id="Don’t-keep-builds-broken"><a href="#Don’t-keep-builds-broken" class="headerlink" title="Don’t keep builds broken"></a>Don’t keep builds broken</h2><p>If you keep (Jenkins) builds broken, how would you know when they find new bugs?<br>Failing builds should be dealt with swiftly.</p>
<h2 id="Document-your-changes-51"><a href="#Document-your-changes-51" class="headerlink" title="Document your changes (51)"></a>Document your changes (51)</h2><p>After a week or two, people will start to forget what does what, or what changed so it no longer does what.<br>It is probably for the best to dedicate some time to document the most updated state of any system, so you won’t need to read through all the code to find out how something works.</p>
<h1 id="Working-with-teams"><a href="#Working-with-teams" class="headerlink" title="Working with teams"></a>Working with teams</h1><h2 id="Demos-are-done-to-impress-3-38"><a href="#Demos-are-done-to-impress-3-38" class="headerlink" title="Demos are done to impress (~3, 38)"></a>Demos are done to impress (~3, 38)</h2><blockquote>
<p>“Only demo that which ought to impress”.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Don’t demo useless things.<br>The whole point of the demo is to show [people] what you’ve done (…), not to see what other people have done. Demos are a proof of work or proof of progress, something you should be proud of showing at the end of a development period.</p>
<h2 id="Business-deadlines-are-your-deadlines"><a href="#Business-deadlines-are-your-deadlines" class="headerlink" title="Business deadlines are your deadlines"></a>Business deadlines are your deadlines</h2><p>Usually, you aren’t hired to “work on a project”; you are hired to provide business value. And deadlines indirectly come from the business people who need your project done, so they can <em>actually</em> provide business value.</p>
<h2 id="As-a-team-no-one-knows-what-they’re-doing-4"><a href="#As-a-team-no-one-knows-what-they’re-doing-4" class="headerlink" title="As a team, no one knows what they’re doing (~4)"></a>As a team, no one knows what they’re doing (~4)</h2><p>One day someone might say, “developers should specify acceptance criteria.”<br>Then, in a month or two, the same person can come and say “the stakeholder (read: business) should provide a definition of done.”<br>No one knows what they’re doing.</p>
<h2 id="Pipelines-are-meant-to-be-balanced"><a href="#Pipelines-are-meant-to-be-balanced" class="headerlink" title="Pipelines are meant to be balanced"></a>Pipelines are meant to be balanced</h2><p>Too many code reviews at the same time and it burdens developers.<br>Too many things in test at the same time and it burdens QA.<br>Ideally, when a swim lane reaches a threshold, members should join code review and/or testing, so the overall velocity remains high.</p>
<p>Anyone can be QA. (Even if you suck at it, you can improve, right?)</p>
<h2 id="Don’t-let-QA-find-your-problems"><a href="#Don’t-let-QA-find-your-problems" class="headerlink" title="Don’t let QA find your problems"></a>Don’t let QA find your problems</h2><p>Your code is supposed to be free of bugs the moment it is submitted for review, so that when it passes code reviews, testing will find absolutely nothing.<br>Test your own code like it belongs to your arch enemy.</p>
<h2 id="Be-ready-to-replace-your-seniors"><a href="#Be-ready-to-replace-your-seniors" class="headerlink" title="Be ready to replace your seniors"></a>Be ready to replace your seniors</h2><p>Seniors, and even bosses come and go, and you should be the one ready to fill in their shoes. This gives you, supposedly, an advantage when it comes to readiness.</p>
<h2 id="Release-regularly-36"><a href="#Release-regularly-36" class="headerlink" title="Release regularly (36)"></a>Release regularly (36)</h2><p>The more regular releases are, the more likely bugs are to be found early.<br>Continuous deployment is its own beast so we will look into that on its own.</p>
<p>If you lead a project, you must (at least tell yourself that) release your project at the end of every development period.</p>
<h2 id="Success-metrics-should-be-independent-from-each-other"><a href="#Success-metrics-should-be-independent-from-each-other" class="headerlink" title="Success metrics should be independent from each other"></a>Success metrics should be independent from each other</h2><p>If you set your own goals, make sure they don’t depend on each other. This allows you to meet these goals one by one, and ensure you actually made (e.g. 3) goals, rather than just (e.g. 1).</p>
<h2 id="Plan-the-backlog-not-the-sprint-27"><a href="#Plan-the-backlog-not-the-sprint-27" class="headerlink" title="Plan the backlog, not the sprint (27)"></a>Plan the backlog, not the sprint (27)</h2><p>Developers should be taking the first task at the top of the backlog for more work.<br>Unordered backlogs mean unhappy developers (because unhappy businessmen don’t get the right features done). (34)</p>
<blockquote>
<p>If you don’t plan the sprints, when will they stop failing? - The wise man</p>

Work on one thing, finish it, then work on another.</p>
<h2 id="Make-suggestions-not-criticisms-29"><a href="#Make-suggestions-not-criticisms-29" class="headerlink" title="Make suggestions, not criticisms (29)"></a>Make suggestions, not criticisms (29)</h2><p>Doing code reviews can be fun, especially when you bash someone else’s head in for writing atrocious code.<br>But resist that sadistic temptation. Help the other person grow by making suggestions. Forcing yourself to architectural questions also helps with your critical thinking.</p>
<h2 id="Keep-confidential-information-confidential-35"><a href="#Keep-confidential-information-confidential-35" class="headerlink" title="Keep confidential information confidential (35)"></a>Keep confidential information confidential (35)</h2><p>Put your company in a good light.

<p>Leverage historical data to judge how fast your developers can work.</p>
<h2 id="Have-retrospectives-1"><a href="#Have-retrospectives-1" class="headerlink" title="Have retrospectives (1)"></a>Have retrospectives (1)</h2><p>Retrospectives are a way to reflect on what you have done, and to find ways to improve from then onward.<br>Retrospectives should have actionable items (40) that are SMART, and to be revisited the next time, so you can be sure you improved over time.</p>

<h1 id="How-not-to-procrastinate"><a href="#How-not-to-procrastinate" class="headerlink" title="How not to procrastinate"></a>How not to procrastinate</h1><p>Learning a new thing or doing something you would rather not do can be stressing. This can cause anxiety at first. This activates the area associated with pain in the brain.</p>
<p>Your brain looks for a way to stop that negative feeling by switching your attention to something else more pleasant.</p>
<p><strong>The solution is to just start.</strong> Researchers discovered that not long after people start actually working out what they didn’t like, that neuro-discomfort disappeared. Remember that the better you get at something, the more enjoyable it can become.</p>
<p>Sleep is very important. Exercising produces new neurons, so it is also very important.</p>
<h1 id="Learning-effectively"><a href="#Learning-effectively" class="headerlink" title="Learning effectively"></a>Learning effectively</h1><p>Learn through association, and many concepts will become one, occupying “one memory”. This allows you to learn more.</p>
<p>Turn off distractions, solve problems, and recall without looking at the material. <strong>Repetition is key.</strong> Test yourself as necessary.</p>
<p>Use a familiar place (like the blueprint of your house) and associate visual images of things you want to remember with physical places.</p>
