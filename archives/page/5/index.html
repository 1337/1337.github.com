<li><strong>Think simple</strong>: the average, dumb person can do this.</li>
<li><strong>Search everywhere</strong>: look under tables and rugs, except places that are clearly not part of the game, such as inside fire extinguishers and behind electrical sockets.</li>
<li><strong>Srganise your clues</strong>: so you know what’s missing, as well as keeping used clues in its own pile.</li>
<li><strong>Focus on what’s stopping you from moving forward</strong>: working backward from what you need to unblock it.</li>
<li><strong>Identify team roles</strong>: most important one being a project manager who identifies what needs to be done.</li>
<li><strong>Know your lock types</strong>: Combo locks need numbers (and sometimes letters). Padlocks need keys. If you need to open a padlock, look for keys.</li>
<li><strong>Identify code types</strong>: like morse code and braille.</li>
<li><strong>Be good at identifying hidden clues</strong></li>
<li><strong>Look for patterns</strong></li>

    	<p><strong>tl;dr</strong>: Ignorance leads to bigotry. And then they vote.</p>
<p>Emphasis mine:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>What real effect (do alternative facts) have on your or their daily life?</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>The effect is so great, I can’t think of a single more important task to undertake.<br>You’re thinking, “who cares if somebody thinks the Earth is flat,” and you’re missing the bigger picture: this is just one symptom of a population incapable of critical thinking.<br>Some people who don’t believe in scientific evidence and think the government is lying to them believe vaccines cause autism. They’re responsible for an increase in the number of measles cases, including in the small percentage of people who were vaccinated, but the vaccine wasn’t effective for them, or can’t be vaccinated for legitimate medical reasons.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Some people who don’t believe in scientific evidence and think the government is lying refuse to accept global warming is real. <strong>They’re actively voting against candidates supporting investment in renewable technologies of the future</strong>, and against a carbon tax that would not only help migration towards these technologies, but offset the cost in disaster relief the government is having to spend due to current increase in number and severity of weather events like hurricanes as a result of global warming. It’s an externality of fossil fuels: we’re already paying the carbon tax, in the form of extra expenditures, (…) but we haven’t associated that cost with the fossil fuels, so it looks like it’s cheaper than it is and slows down the switch to green tech.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Some people who don’t believe in scientific evidence elect school board members who don’t believe in evolution and require text books that “teach the controversy,” and downplay the scientific evidence. They’re lowering the quality of our public schools.<br>Some people who think all beliefs are the same, and science is just another religion, call educated individuals the “intellectual elite” for acting like they know better than they do. Entirely missing the point that they do. That’s what education is, the gaining of additional knowledge. It’s incredible to me how many people refuse to listen to economists, or climate scientists, or physicists, or evolutionary biologists, because they think their opinion is worth just as much. Simultaneously, these people want an actual lawyer if they go to court, and an actual doctor of they’re sick. Although, there are those who don’t, and they’re even worse: people who chose to defend themselves in court and go to jail when they’re innocent, which is not only an injustice, but it’s a drain on my tax dollars. Parents who refuse to allow a doctor to give a simple treatment that would cure their child in favor of their faith healer, and the child dies instead. These people tend to go to jail too for negligence, and not only was an innocent life lost, it’s again <strong>a drain on my tax dollars</strong>.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>The type of ignorance is responsible for random acts of violence. A conspiracy nut who believed in pizzagate shot up a pizza parlor in NYC because he believed there was a child sex ring in the basement. There was no basement.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>This type of ignorance leads to bigots. <strong>There’s nothing wrong with faith, but when they believe their faith is a fact and that they can’t be wrong</strong>, they discriminate against homosexuals, against people of other faiths, against people of no faiths. Polls consistently show Americans would rather vote for a pedophile than an atheist, and considering Roy Moore almost won his election, it’s not hyperbole. He got the votes he did because he pandered to the faith above fact crowd: global warming is a hoax, no abortion, Muslims should not be able to hold office in the US, etc.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>The flat earthers are just the extreme case of the above. There’s an overlap of the above beliefs, as well as a specific disinclination for voting towards candidates that wasn’t to fund NASA and other studies. We just got a picture of a black hole 54 million light-years away. <strong>You think these people support funding scientific efforts in a field they don’t believe in?</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>But don’t narrow yourself to this specific unscientific belief. The flat earthers are one example. <strong>Willingness to ignore scientific evidence is the problem, no matter what field.</strong> We must fight against it whenever we see it, we must seek to educate, we must seek to find out what causes people to get in that state and restructure education to help prevent it. If we could solve this one problem, we’ll build paradise on Earth. <strong>Every other problem we have is solvable with time, if humans stop denying evidence in favor of what they want to believe.</strong> And it’s hard. I’m not saying I’m better than these people, I’m human too. I know I must do it from time to time, and not realize it. I want people to engage me when it happens, I want them to snap me out of it, and <strong>I want to live with a philosophy of constant questioning of my own convictions</strong> in an attempt to minimize that behavior in me, and make it easier to correct it when it does happen.</p>

    	<p>There appears to be no good way to run a flake8 plugin that is not its own package. For example, if you have a project and you want to include a custom flake8 inside it, you will have to <em>install your project</em> to <a href="https://flake8.pycqa.org/en/latest/plugin-development/registering-plugins.html" target="_blank" rel="external">register</a> it:</p>
<pre><code># Me literally installing myself so flake8 can find it 
from setuptools import setup

    author=&apos;Me&apos;,
    license=&apos;Proprietary&apos;,
    classifiers=[
        &apos;License :: Other/Proprietary License&apos;,
    ],
    packages=[
        &apos;my_static_checker&apos;,

    entry_points={

            &apos;R2 = my_static_checker.main:Checker&apos;,
        ],
    },
)
</code></pre><p>As for what <code>Checker</code> checking, it is largely up to you, as long as the class contains a <code>run</code> method that yields four things:</p>
<pre><code>import ast

class Checker:
    name = &apos;my_static_checker&apos;
    version = &apos;0.1&apos;

    def __init__(self, tree, filename):
        self.tree = tree
        self.filename = filename

    def run(self):
        # Use whatever tool you like to find these, but ast is imported
        errors = (line, column, message)
        for line, column, message in errors:

    	<p>Excerpts. Interpretation of the <a href="http://antirez.com/news/124" target="_blank" rel="external">source</a>. If you want to see examples for any of these, go check out the source.</p>
<h2 id="Why-write-comments"><a href="#Why-write-comments" class="headerlink" title="Why write comments"></a>Why write comments</h2><p>Comments are rubber duck debugging on steroids, except you are not talking with a rubber duck, but with the future reader of the code. You explain why what you are doing <em>is acceptable</em>, honorable, or good enough. And if it is not, you make your homework, and come up with something more decent.</p>
<p>Comments also help others understand you and your work.</p>
<h2 id="Do-write-Function-comments-aka-docstrings"><a href="#Do-write-Function-comments-aka-docstrings" class="headerlink" title="Do write: Function comments aka docstrings"></a>Do write: Function comments aka docstrings</h2><p>Function comments are actually a form of in-line API documentation.</p>
<ul>
<li>The reader should be able to use a function without understanding the implementation, i.e. treating the function as a black box.</li>
<li>Putting docstrings for functions directly where they are defined helps the reader focus on the code, instead of context switching between code and documentation.</li>
</ul>
<p>Notes:</p>
<ul>
<li>You need to update the docstring whenever you change the code. Yes you need to check this when you change the function, but the benefits outweigh the “the code is the only source of truth” argument.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="Do-write-Design-comments-aka-module-docstrings"><a href="#Do-write-Design-comments-aka-module-docstrings" class="headerlink" title="Do write: Design comments aka module docstrings"></a>Do write: Design comments aka module docstrings</h2><p>The design comment states how and why a given piece of code uses certain algorithms, techniques, tricks, and implementation. It is an higher level overview of what you’ll see implemented in the code. With such background, reading the code will be simpler.</p>
<ul>
<li>Why is this trivial-looking module not <em>actually</em> trivial?</li>
<li>Why is a particular algorithm design chosen instead of something else? (explains why the author is not just being lazy.)</li>
</ul>
<p>Notes:</p>
<ul>
<li>Apart from function and design comments, other types of comments here don’t necessarily come in the form of a docstring.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="Do-write-Why-comments"><a href="#Do-write-Why-comments" class="headerlink" title="Do write: Why comments"></a>Do write: Why comments</h2><p>Why comments explain the reason why the code is doing something, even if <em>what</em> the code is doing is crystal clear.</p>
<ul>
<li>Why is this function clearing the user cookie?</li>
<li>Why is this function clearing the user cookie after a certain function call, and not before?</li>
<li>Why is this thing written this way, and not a more obvious way?</li>
<li>Why shouldn’t I change this line here? (hint: it’s harmful for reasons that are not obvious.)</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="Do-write-Teacher-comments"><a href="#Do-write-Teacher-comments" class="headerlink" title="Do write: Teacher comments"></a>Do write: Teacher comments</h2><p>Teacher comments teach the reader the domain (for example math, computer graphics, networking, statistics, complex data structures) in which the code is operating, that may be one outside of the reader skills set, or is simply too full of details to recall all them from memory.</p>
<ul>
<li>What is the haversine formula?</li>
<li>What is this data structure that the code is using?</li>
<li>Corner cases that this implementation is, and is not, designed to take care of.</li>
</ul>
<p>Notes:</p>
<ul>
<li>Teacher comments do not relate to the code.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="Do-write-Checklist-comments"><a href="#Do-write-Checklist-comments" class="headerlink" title="Do write: Checklist comments"></a>Do write: Checklist comments</h2><p>Checklist comments tell you if you do one thing, you need to do other specific things as well.</p>
<ul>
<li>It tells you a set of actions to do when something is modified.</li>
<li>It warns you about the way certain changes should be operated.</li>
</ul>
<p>Notes:</p>
<ul>
<li>Unlike “why comments”, the checklist comment used in the same case is more biased towards telling you what rules to follow if you want to modify it, without breaking the code behavior.</li>
<li>Checklist comments are very common inside the Linux kernel, where the order of certain operations is extremely important.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="Do-write-Guide-comments"><a href="#Do-write-Guide-comments" class="headerlink" title="Do write: Guide comments"></a>Do write: Guide comments</h2><p>Guide comments’ sole reason to exist is to lower the cognitive load of the programmer reading some code. <strong>They are (…) what most people believe to be completely useless comments.</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Guide comments are step-by-step, line-by-line comments that make a piece of code easier to read.</li>
<li>They’ll acknowledge you about the fact you are understanding it right.</li>
</ul>
<p>Notes:</p>
<ul>
<li>If the code isn’t actually hard to read, these comments become “Trivial comments” (see below). If you want to leave guide comments, make sure the comment is necessary.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="Do-not-write-Trivial-comments"><a href="#Do-not-write-Trivial-comments" class="headerlink" title="Do not write: Trivial comments"></a>Do not write: Trivial comments</h2><ul>
<li>Trivial comments tell you, say, it is incrementing a variable, on the line that increments a variable.</li>
<li>Trivial comments state “<em>what</em> the code is doing, and not why.”</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="Do-not-write-Debt-comments"><a href="#Do-not-write-Debt-comments" class="headerlink" title="Do not write: Debt comments"></a>Do not write: Debt comments</h2><p>FIXME, TODO, XXX, “This is a hack”, are all forms of debt comments.</p>
<p>The issue with debt comments are these FIXMEs might require a different kind of fix in the future, which may mislead a future author into doing the wrong thing. </p>
<h2 id="Do-not-write-Backup-comments"><a href="#Do-not-write-Backup-comments" class="headerlink" title="Do not write: Backup comments"></a>Do not write: Backup comments</h2><p>Backup comments are commented-out code.</p>
<h2 id="Thinking-outside-the-box-commenting-outside-the-file"><a href="#Thinking-outside-the-box-commenting-outside-the-file" class="headerlink" title="Thinking outside the box: commenting outside the file"></a>Thinking outside the box: commenting outside the file</h2><p>Certain IDEs offer <a href="https://www.jetbrains.com/help/idea/external-annotations.html" target="_blank" rel="external">external annotation</a> capabilities, which, to some degree, allows you to write as many comments (read: as much bullshit) as you want, similar to how Google Docs shows collaborator comments in the gutter. This has two benefits:</p>
<ul>
<li>People who don’t like reading comments can turn them off.</li>
<li>Source code files are really 100% executable.</li>
</ul>
<p>This worsens one problem:</p>
<ul>
<li>Docs get out of date. Now, not only do they get out of date, you will also need a compatible IDE to read them.</li>
</ul>
<p>Nothing of this kind exists—perhaps for a reason—but it is definitely an idea worth exploring.</p>
