<p>Heard from someone I know (but wish not to disclose his/her identity) that Hexo is a nice framework to use for generating a static blog. Having never done that before, I thought, what the hell!</p>
<p>My experience with Hexo has been very pleasant (or… much better than my previous encounters with node and npm). Here are a few take-aways:</p>
<ul>
<li>Incorrect permissions of the local npm cache (caused by <code>sudo</code>) <em>can</em> and <em>will</em> fail most of the npm- and nodejs-related tasks that you will be running.</li>
<li>Inserting images in Hexo (apparently <code>/source</code> is the root path, not <code>/</code> as the config suggests)</li>
<li><a href="https://www.npmjs.org/package/hexo-livereload" target="_blank" rel="external"><code>livereload</code></a> requires <a href="http://feedback.livereload.com/knowledgebase/articles/86242-how-do-i-install-and-use-the-browser-extensions-" target="_blank" rel="external">a browser plugin</a>.</li>
<li>You need to <em>click</em> on livereload’s button in the browser…</li>
<li>EJS, because <a href="https://github.com/joyceim/hexo-theme-apollo" target="_blank" rel="external">the theme</a> uses it</li>
<li>Stylus, because that’s also what the theme requires; it allows semicolons and brackets to be omitted anywhere you want!</li>
<li>Apparently <a href="http://code.tutsplus.com/tutorials/sass-vs-less-vs-stylus-preprocessor-shootout--net-24320" target="_blank" rel="external">SASS is deprecating its bracket-free syntax</a></li>
<li>How to <a href="http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/syntax" target="_blank" rel="external">create referenced links</a>.</li>
<li>How to <a href="http://hexo.io/docs/deployment.html" target="_blank" rel="external">deploy this blog</a>. Booboo! You don’t commit and push – you deploy and push to a draft branch.</li>
<li><a href="http://blog.lazywei.com/2013/11/24/how-do-i-configure-my-hexo-blog/" target="_blank" rel="external">Deploying blogs to github under a custom domain.</a></li>
</ul>
<p>It has been an amazing learning experience! I’m taking a lot of notes as I go. More to come tomorrow.</p>

    	<p>I had a tight schedule yesterday, because I had to go to the train station right after church, so that I can catch a train to downtown Toronto. This is my first time going downtown alone, so I needed a lot of help.</p>
<p>Surrogate helped search for the correct train route to get to Union Station (the main station). While I was waiting for the train, I started a conversation with a cyclist called Michael, a young (25ish?) white male, who was also waiting for the train. He was wrapped in spandex and had a good racing bike. we talked on the train, about life (“I was born in Nova Scotia” “Same here”) and death (“The people where I came from have no place to get themselves buried” “wow”) and everything in between (“The Canadian dollar is dropping like-“ “I know”), all the way until we got to Union station.</p>
<p>We didn’t exchange numbers because I don’t think there’s anything to do even IF we meet again. What, meet up for tea or something? I thanked him for his help around the station, and we went our own ways.</p>
<p>I got to That Guy’s place (University of Toronto) by the transit system (“TTC”). His campus wasn’t big, but is entirely accessible by car. Waterloo’s academic buildings are rarely accessible by cars - and there are tons of parking spaces for that reason.</p>
<p>The other guy from McMaster and another man from Waterloo were at That Guy’s dorm as well, because they came over for thanksgiving too. We four went out the whole day and bought bubble tea. Considering the non-locality of this speciality, the bubble tea was actually pretty good.</p>
<p>The Asiatown here is massive. At least it’s massive compared to what we have in Waterloo (“there is none”). We walked around Chinatown, went to Eaton Center (the big shopping mall everyone makes a big deal about) and froze all the computers in the newly open Apple store, all thanks to another man from Waterloo, the mac expert.</p>
<p>We went to a book store there and read mini books which they sell. Looking at these books, I might consider making mini books again…. they have market. Apparently.</p>
<p>We walked for 9 hours in total, covering the day from 12pm to 10pm. We had dinner at an empty pizza shop because everywhere else was packed. We had an idea why the shop was empty - the cashier doesn’t have good attitude. Beggars asking us for food too, and we gave him excess onion rings. We could have given him more garlic bread but we forgot.</p>
<p>There are 6000 homeless people in this town, but nobody really cares… </p>

    	<p>The steps for producing a smelly piece of tofu is as follows:</p>
<ol>
<li>Add to a hot pan, a piece of tofu. Fry until golden.</li>
<li>Reduce heat to medium and wait for water to dry up.</li>
<li>Add to pan a portion of peanut butter. Roll tofu on top of it.</li>
<li>Raise heat to max.</li>
<li>Smelly tofu will be done when all peanut butter is melted and burnt.</li>

    	<p>I have a person called Zamiul (male) as my chemistry lab partner for this term. Since I had a chem lab just then this evening, I’ve decided to tell you what kind of person he is.</p>
<p>Today’s experiment was about the oxidation of copper (if you make positive copper ions from copper solid, that’s oxidation), further oxidation of copper (if you bind an oxygen with copper, that’s oxidation as well), and finally, the reduction of copper using zinc (Cu2+ + Zn –&gt; Zn2+ + Cu). As chemists of my age, we should really have done this in high school. Simple stuff.</p>
<p>What’s interesting about Zamiul is his total lack of knowledge on chemistry, yet still enrolled in the class. Nobody’s sure how he did it, nor did he say how. Over the course of today’s lab, he had clearly shown chemical incompetence in what he did and what he said. Notable cases include</p>
<p>Me: “Hey, what did you put in that cylinder?”</p>
<p>Zamiul: “10mL of NOH.”</p>
<p>“What?”</p>
<p>“NOH. Nitric… hydroxide.”</p>
<p>“NaOH?”</p>
<p>He looked at the booklet (which costed us $15 each), pondered, and said: “Yeah, NaOH, sodium hydroxide.”</p>
<p>NaOH, being one of the first chemicals you use in chemistry (it’s “the strong base”), should be known by all and thought of when you’re asleep. This Zamiul, however, failed to even notice it is a base.</p>
<p>He went on talking. “I know NaOH. Na is sodium… a group 2 metal.”</p>
<p>I replied bluntly: “no, it isn’t.”</p>
<p>“What, it’s not in group 2?”</p>
<p>“You should… read up before next week’s lab.”</p>
<p>A while later, he came back to me and asked, “OP, why does the solution become alkaline after you add NaOH?”</p>
<p>“NaOH is alkaline.”</p>
<p>“Oh.”</p>
<p>It’s going to be a tough term for him… and possibly for me.</p>

    	<p>Have you ever had the feeling where you’ve left a place you used to live for so long that it felt alien when you returned? That was exactly how I felt when I got to the Pearson airport. The people there were mostly white, though most of the “may I help you?” luggage people were Indians… I didn’t recall seeing any of that years ago.</p>
<p>Road signs were all in English. French words which you thought you could read but couldn’t. Miles of plain grass and undeveloped lands. Highways sparsely populated. And the most spectacular - clean sky, beautiful clouds, and a sunset everyone here takes for granted.</p>
<p>I moved into campus residence at the end of August. To accomplish this, things needed to be bought in advance. Such things are obviously cheaper wherever I came from, but were not bought there because of their mass/weight/relative uselessness:</p>
<ul>
<li>Washing detergent<br>For dishes and clothes. Both are heavy, chemical fluids. You won’t be able to board a plane with them, nor will you want to.</li>
<li>Shampoo, body wash, etc etc<br>Again, huge bottles of chemicals. Leaks on impact, confiscated at customs.</li>
<li>Books for this term only</li>
<li>Some medicine<br>“Tylenol” seems remarkably cheaper here than it is in Hong Kong - 6 CAD for 100 tablets. Treats fevers, colds and headaches, the most common problems for university students. Why not?</li>
<li>Blanket sheets, tissue, binders, printer, winter clothing<br>Items which are not worth bringing over, were not brought over.</li>
<li>Paper<br>Cheap and bulky.</li>
</ul>
<p>On more than two occasions, someone invited me to their basement to look for my old property. It was good to see those things again. Some things were more useful than others:</p>
<ul>
<li>I found yet another Swiss knife key chain from my pile of junk. So now I have 3 with me and I’ll probably be bring at least one to university for, maybe, opening cans and such.</li>
<li>A large quantity of stationery was trashed: old pens can’t write, rulers frozen into half, etc.</li>
<li>Lots of clothing. Many were too small, but some can still be kept.</li>
<li>Coins.</li>
<li>Folders, binder tabs, scissors, cutters, etc: essential tools for success.</li>
<li>Rollerblades: it can possibly be useful in a huge campus like this one.</li>
<li>Dictionaries - but I’m probably not going to need one</li>
</ul>
<p>The Surrogate family also contributed a lot to this brian-is-going-to-uni-for-his-first-time project, and it’s noteworthy that not only did they sacrifice their time / effort / food / accommodation / gasoline (which they might claim money for) for this project, they have also provided at least the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>AA batteries (I don’t know where they got them, but I don’t see them buying them specifically) for the</li>
<li>flashlight, which they also found in their basement</li>
<li>Stapler, and a whole pack of staples</li>
<li>Double clips</li>
<li>Maps</li>
<li>Some clothes they never knew existed</li>
<li>Plain paper</li>
<li>Blankets, pillows, and their covers</li>
<li>An abandoned mug warmer</li>
<li>Some of their medicine</li>
<li>Tissue</li>
</ul>
<p>During the week between the day of arrival and the day I moved into the campus, we’ve also spent hundreds of dollars, purchasing items necessary for school, partially mentioned above. Bills will probably be mailed to you soon and the figures won’t look interesting. I think you say “don’t worry about the fees” because you haven’t seen the bills just yet.</p>
