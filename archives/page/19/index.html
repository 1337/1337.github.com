    	<p><a href="https://xkcd.com/320/" target="_blank" rel="external">One of the first xkcd comics</a> (#320) describes a 28-hour day, where six of such days sum up to 168 hours, which is also what seven 24-hour days add up to. The person would then stay up for 20 hours, sleep eight hours after that, and repeat the process. Of course, ignoring the daylight factor (which, if you have a daylight-dependent sleeping schedule, you would not be reading this in the first place), a person still needs to work, play, planning such a six-day week around the world that revolves around them. What does that look like?</p>
<p><img src="/image/7-day.png" alt=""></p>
<p>If your workplace allows somewhat flexible hours, or if they only specify core hours, then by shifting your Tuesday schedule a bit late, and your Friday schedule a bit early, then you are only 10% deviated from the rest of the world, in a typical 40-hour work week. If the place of employment really wants you to put 40 hours during <em>their</em> workdays, just shift that excel spreadsheet left by four days. Now, you start work two hours early on their Monday, and start two hours late on their Friday. In such a plan, like normal human beings, you will not be working during normal weekends.</p>
<h2 id="What-does-it-look-like-to-you"><a href="#What-does-it-look-like-to-you" class="headerlink" title="What does it look like to you?"></a>What does it look like to you?</h2><p><img src="/image/6-day.png" alt=""></p>
<p>At first, if you commit to centering your life around your sleep, then you get eight hours of sleep at “midnight” every day. The time at which you leave for work will be drastically different every “day”. On day 1 (whatever name you give it), you will work at 10am. On day 4, you will start working at 8pm, finishing at “28pm”, your midnight.</p>
<h2 id="Bonus-exercise-when-do-shops-open"><a href="#Bonus-exercise-when-do-shops-open" class="headerlink" title="Bonus exercise: when do shops open?"></a>Bonus exercise: <em>when do shops open?</em></h2><p>Enough about work. Your life is a lot more than just work. How about food? How about entertainment? When are things open relative to your 6-day week? Well, highlighting the 9am~7pm range, when shops are typically open and available to you?</p>
<p><img src="/image/6-day-ds.png" alt=""></p>
<p>Well, as it turns out, there are not that many hours that you have to shop when both you and other human beings are awake. On most days, you can get away with shopping after work; it might be a bit strange for your “weekend” day, for there are three shopping hours immediately after you wake up, and three more right before you go to bed. No more eight-hour activities for you!</p>

    	<p>The Apple Keynote took place on 2016-09-07. I stayed up all night to catch it, and I must say, I am very impressed. Apple had jam-packed their newest products with new technology, that allow us to do more with our lives. The seven key takeaways are as follows:</p>
<p><img src="/image/apple-iphone.jpg" alt=""></p>
<ol>
<li>The Apple Watch series 2 is the first water-resistant Apple Watch in the world. At just $369, you can track your <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shower" target="_blank" rel="external">everyday swim</a>, using the same battery that offers great battery life of 18 hours when off.</li>
<li>Apple released the world’s first Apple Watch with built-in GPS. The new watch gives owners a second screen on which they may play Pokemon Go, with the iPhone 7 still in the pocket.</li>
<li>The all-new iPhone 7, also released today, is also water-resistant, without the use of a case. Because the glossy black iPhone 7 is manufactured using a <em>precision nine-step anodization and polishing process</em>, <a href="http://www.theverge.com/circuitbreaker/2016/9/7/12836762/iphone-7-announced-black-scratch" target="_blank" rel="external">Apple recommends getting a case.</a></li>
<li>Compared to the previous generation iPhone 6S, the new iPhone 7 offers a better processor, <a href="http://forum.xda-developers.com/oneplus-one/development/mod-oneplus-one-stereo-mod-t2967925" target="_blank" rel="external">stereo speakers</a>, all while adding two more hours of battery life, in addition to a <a href="http://www.theverge.com/circuitbreaker/2016/9/7/12828652/apple-iphone-7-home-button-removed-force-touch" target="_blank" rel="external">solid state home button</a> that is the world’s first on an iPhone.</li>
<li>The earphone jack on the iPhone 7 is now <a href="http://appleplugs.com/" target="_blank" rel="external">replaced</a> with an <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Android/comments/51mv8m/with_the_apple_keynote_finished_what_are_your/d7d5zv2" target="_blank" rel="external"><em>included</em></a> <a href="http://www.macrumors.com/2016/09/07/apple-3-5-mm-jack-lightning-adapter/" target="_blank" rel="external">lightning-to-3.5mm adapter</a>, that lets you listen to music using the iPhone 7. The adapter is $9 from the store. In addition to the adapter, Apple also offers a <a href="http://www.apple.com/shop/product/MMTN2AM/A/earpods-with-lightning-connector" target="_blank" rel="external">$29-pair of earphones that can be plugged directly into the Lightning port.</a> Replacing the 3.5mm jack, lightning cables can also be inserted upside down.</li>
<li>Speaking of wired adapters, wireless is in, and wires are the way to go (except Lightning cables). The AirPods are an impressive breakthrough in wireless earbud technology. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CHCQO4zfkiE" target="_blank" rel="external"><em>Loaded with sensors and filled with so much tech</em></a>, users can listen to music for up to five hours. AirPods are also the first Apple wireless earbuds to feature <a href="http://www.apple.com/airpods/" target="_blank" rel="external">Siri integration</a>, dual internal batteries, and infrared sensors.</li>
<li>Despite being Apple’s cheapest wireless earbuds offering, <a href="http://qz.com/776012/apple-appl-iphone-event-new-wireless-airpod-earbuds-are-most-apple-product-ever/" target="_blank" rel="external">all AirPods come with a free carrying case</a>, that not only keeps the AirPods safe, but also charges Apple’s first pair of earbuds that need to be charged. Unlike everything else released today, neither the AirPods nor the case are resistant to water.</li>
</ol>
<p>All things considered, a very promising Keynote, very good pricing, and an excellent start to Apple’s fiscal quarter. Pre-orders start as soon as next week.</p>

&gt;&gt;Yes, because I expect the FBI to actually be on top of shit. The CIA can go fuck around and do whatever it is they do and the NSA can go about being creepy, but I honestly expect good to come from the FBI.

    	<p><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/1g1skk/what_should_i_negotiate_when_buying_a_car/cag03zo" target="_blank" rel="external">Source</a> by /u/tjanderl. Spoiler: sometimes you don’t want to buy a used car.</p>
<p>You need to see it on a lift, remember suspension holds the wheels on and can cost between 1500 to 5000 dollars to replace.</p>
<p>To check the shocks and struts: Open car door, stand on the jam, give it a bounce, it should travel down and back up ONCE. if it does anymore the car is riding on springs, this is a 1500 dollars right off the bat, not fixing it will ruin tires and the springs.</p>
<p>Find an area to drive the car in tight circles, listen for any creeking this generally indicates bad ball joints (which can kill you) or bad bushings which will degrade handling significantly.</p>
<p>Look at it on a lift: Almost any component of the suspension that is a joint has a bushing, make sure the plastic bushings are not cracked, make sure any rubber boots are intact as well, a boot is seen where axles meet their wheel/differential, it looks like a rubber accordion and it holds oil to lubricate the joints inside, if they are cracking or damaged the oil will eventually drain and that joint will overheat and seize.</p>
<p>Don’t be afraid to pop the hood, make sure the engine bay is clean, check the oil, pull the dipstick and tap it ever so gently onto a paper towel, the oil will soak in and the dirt will sit on the towel, if there is a lot of dirt sitting on the towel it’s a good bet the oil hasn’t been changed regularly. Make sure fluid levels are OK, some used cars go right to the lot and off fluid levels are signs of improper maintenance. Proper maintenance correlates directly with engine life.</p>
<p>Listen to the engine with the hood open, you don’t want to hear any rhythmic ticking or knocking, you will however hear the mechanical flutter of the valves. No squeals should be heard either.</p>
<p>Speaking of the engine while the car is on the lift inspect any hoses you see, if they are moist and dirty looking the car has been leaking something, be it brake power steering coolant or oil. Leaks are generally cheap fixes but seeing tons of them is a sign the car was poorly maintained.</p>
<p>Inspect the body and underside for rust, non-painted items will rust like the brake rotors etc. This is fine as they are designed to or are eventually maintenance replaced parts, the body shell however shouldn’t be rusting, if it is you’re in for trouble down the line.</p>
<p>Make sure all the electronics in the car work during your test drive, most of all be thorough.</p>
<p>Anything you find wrong (and with used something always will be) is a point where you can talk down the price, don’t worry about having looked at other cars you can still bullshit them by saying “I was looking at a fairly clean and solid civic for X but I like this car more, although I see the bushings are going, that’s a pricey fix can we get that fixed at an X discount before buying?”</p>
<p>If they won’t put it on a lift open the hood or let a mechanic of your choosing inspect the car say no, these are generally crooks who want to sell you a lemon and laugh all the way to the bank.</p>
<p>If you are looking at cars in the 15,000 dollar range you are probably looking at fairly new CPOs, why not just buy a new compact car and ensure the maintenance is done properly from the beginning? You can get a civic in hatch non hatch coupe or sedan in the 17-23 range? The only reason I ask is you honestly don’t save much and can often talk a dealership down when financing a new car to almost where a CPO car is priced, they are less likely to budge down a lot on the price of a CPO or used car, the non-CPO used car market is pay way too much for a piece of shit because cash for clunkers took a lot of good used cars out of existence, as well as parts since all those cars were all scrapped.</p>
<p>Seriously if you buy new and stay dedicated to changing the oil ever 6K miles, tranny fluid 36k and every 18k after, coolant and brake fluid yearly, and power steering with the tranny any modern car will make 100K miles and 6 years without needing serious maintenance, AKA you will pay it off before you start replacing serious parts. Think about a 6 year loan on a new car with 5K down rather than looking at used, just some food for though, if you plan on owning the car for 10 years you’ll be ahead of the pains of a used car.</p>
<p>edit: Seriously consider new, here’s an example of how fucked the used car market is: A ‘99 civic in my area are selling for 8000 dollars with 80k miles, that’s 20K away from cooling system rebuild, timing belt replacement, shock/strut replacement, as well as rotors and drums and most likely not maintained well. A 2010 civic sedan Certified Pre-Owned (CPO) are going for 16,000 dollars with 15-25K miles on the clock, brand new custom ordered and delivered base-package hondas are 18,165 dollars. So let’s look at our civic options:</p>
<p>8000-dollar Civic: About to need roughly $3000 in maintenance in 2 years time, so it’ll cost you 11-12K before you wish you bought a new car…. It’s also going to eat through gas, at 100K you generally loose 3-5 MPG off the sticker and well older cars eat gas anyways. A ‘99 civic will be getting you 17 city and 25 highway. The v-tech has some seals that start to go in it as most variable valve systems do, the ECU adapts but the low-end torque always sucks once the v-tech looses it’s youth, and that’s what you use most unless you do nothing but highway miles.</p>
<p>CPO: 16,000 for a slightly used newer vehicle, chances are you won’t talk them down too far on the price since they put money into it certifying as well as most likely it being a lease someone didn’t want to buy after the terms were up, they probably made 5 grand off it and want to turn a profit on finally getting rid of the thing.</p>
<p>New: 18,000, very negotiable as you can say “Well I was looking at a new subaru that is 17,500 that I like more” and you can really haggle when buying new, plus the dealer makes more off financing a new car than anything else, they’ll take a 2K loss on the car to make 5K back. You could also order the car custom built with your favorite color paint and interior etc. you can make a spreadsheet and maintain the car correctly and get 15 years 250K miles out of it easily, plus all the modern standard amenities like bluetooth aux ports built in nav heated seats and mirrors etc.</p>
