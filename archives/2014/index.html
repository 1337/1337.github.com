    	<p>Welcome to StartupCompany. In this guide, you will learn what is necessary to work with StartupCompany as a developer.</p>
<ol>
<li>You will be assigned tasks to work on. As our development is results-driven, you will not be given deadlines until the due date.</li>
<li>The business team makes decisions based on the team’s intuition. You will be notified of their intuition when the client demands something.</li>
<li>Often, deadlines may be from an earlier point in time.</li>
<li>We run our in-house Test-Driven Development (TDD). All our tests are currently passing – new team members are expected to write zero tests.</li>
<li>StartupCompany. frequently gives away free trials to customers. The conversion rate of these trials has so far been 0%. Your responsibility is to make these free trials a reality. </li>
<li>As a form of money management, the CEO will pay you with money that will eventually exist in six-month’s time. If there is no money in the bank before the sixth month, you will not be paid.</li>
<li>As an expert in the field, you will be expected to write code that works from IE7 to IE12, including development and debug builds of desktop and mobile browsers. </li>
<li>Every developer is encouraged to document their code and processes. You can find our large repository of outdated docs in our FreeProduct repository. </li>
<li>Here at StartupCompany, we strive for results. Using the Thick Loaves(TM) philosophy, you are encouraged to push code to production every 5 minutes, however stable it is, as long as it is stable. (see point 7)  </li>
<li>Employees are expected to complete tasks in under 50% of the allocated time. </li>
<li>We have many clients, and, as such, have to fulfill requirements from each client. You will be creating marvelous work of art that does all that with just one code base. </li>
<li>You, as a new member at StartupCompany, are very special. We treat you like a team. The whole team.</li>
<li>We use Dipchat as our company issue tracker. If you find a bug, please file it inside the room named ‘Developers’. The bugs that you file will not be resolved; the bugs that you address will not be acknowledged.</li>
<li>The Business team has no technical knowledge related to building and designing a product. As such, if they ask you how long something would take to implement, please work with them and reply with ‘a very short time.’</li>
<li>We are a six year-old company, and we have made a lot of great products in the past. You will be working on a relatively new project that needs to have features from all previous iterations.</li>
<li>After reading about Exception-driven development (EDD) on Hacker News, we have adopted it as a practice. The moral of the story here is that if we monitor our systems, then they will not fail.</li>
</ol>

	<div class="entry-content">
		
    	<p>Let me tell you a story about <strong>Medicals</strong>, my personal project from 2004.</p>
<h2 id="Prequel"><a href="#Prequel" class="headerlink" title="Prequel"></a>Prequel</h2><p>I did an educational manoeuvre at around the age of 14. I was an innocent person at the time – so young, so ambitious, yet so full of nothing. My life took a strange turn one day, when the school where I studied decided to give us all a project in Microsoft Access:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Make a form that shows contents of a table. (or something… it was more than a decade ago)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Intuitively, all that a student had to do was to fire up MS Access, create a new database with a form in it, where fields in the form are linked to columns in that table. That would get you 100%. However, being the person that I was, I made such a thing:</p>
<p><img src="/image/sneak_peak_3.jpg" alt="not Medicals"></p>
<p>(The ‘table’ beneath the UI handled expense records, hence the name “Expense”.)</p>
<p>From the screenshot, it was apparent that I made at least 5 iterations of the Expense project.</p>
<p><a href="https://google.com/search?q=David+Kirby" title="I know, I know... it&#39;s a very common name. I can&#39;t find him online, either." target="_blank" rel="external">David Kirby</a>, my ICT (IT) teacher at the time, told me I did a good job.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>I did a good job.</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p>At the age of (a young age), my naivete thought that MS Access was the go-to platform for creating computer interfaces, for realising dreams like others do; ranging from classic address books to entire operating systems, I attempted recreating them all.</p>
<p>FA, Windows 98 in Access!<br><img src="/image/simulator98.png" alt="FA, Windows 98 in Access!"></p>
<p>FA, Windows in Access run on Windows that looks like Mac OS X!<br><img src="/image/simulatormac1.png" alt="FA, Windows in Access run on Windows that looks like Mac OS X!"></p>
<p>FA, Windows XP in Access – it’s even widescreen!<br><img src="/image/simulator23.png" alt="FA, Windows XP in Access -- it&#39;s even widescreen!"></p>
<p>These were all created at the peak of my ignorance. At that age, when the Internet was nothing more than Yahoo! mail, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MSN_Explorer" target="_blank" rel="external">MSN Explorer</a>, and <a href="http://stickdeathreborn.tk" target="_blank" rel="external">stickdeath.com</a>, ignorance is not only bliss–it was my only choice. To make sure you understand how stupid these projects were, everything in the form was an image resource. Each resource points to an image file, which then in turn can be placed on the form. They have pre-written handlers that simply make other elements show and hide.</p>
<p>Then came Medicals.</p>
<h2 id="Medicals-the-early-days"><a href="#Medicals-the-early-days" class="headerlink" title="Medicals: the early days"></a>Medicals: the early days</h2><p>At the height of passionate “software” development, I came up with this ambitious idea while visiting my family doctor, who went by the name of <em>Ng</em>. He was an incompetent wad who happened to be the doctor closest to where my family resided. He had cabinets upon cabinets of patient records that were retrieved by hand. I thought: what if I made something for this guy, who clearly has a need for a computerised system?</p>
<p><img src="/image/medicals.png" alt="Medicals 1.1"></p>
<p><img src="/image/medi13c.png" alt="Medicals 1.3"></p>
<p>Having gained the experience to do stupid things very quickly, Medicals 1.0 (not pictured) was born. The first version, like its predecessors, are merely MS Access forms that link to table entries. However, Medicals 1.3 was a little different. Forms were linked to <em>queries</em> instead, and there was a reporting option, which were <em>reports</em> linked to queries. This allowed the interface to show both information about a particular patient, and a list of medications that was given to the patient (in the image above, the patient was repeatedly given arbitrary doses of Vitamin C).</p>
<p><img src="/image/medi15c2.png" alt="Medicals 1.5"></p>
<p>Medicals 1.5 was “released” in the sense that <code>medicals.mdb</code> was copied elsewhere as <code>medicals15.mdb</code>. From the only surviving screenshot, it can be seen that doctor <em>Ng</em> can now record the number of days for which he prescribed water to the patient.</p>
<h2 id="Medicals-2-where-the-crazy-got-crazier"><a href="#Medicals-2-where-the-crazy-got-crazier" class="headerlink" title="Medicals 2: where the crazy got crazier"></a>Medicals 2: where the crazy got crazier</h2><p>Even a crazy person would, at this point, realise that <em>real</em> people, like a doctor, would not use something, let alone a mission-critical database, from a (young person). However, I was not crazy. I was deranged. I was an energetic, deranged man, who would take this project to the end of its days, until someone, somewhere, actually uses my work for real.</p>
<p>The Medicals 2 series was made “available to the public” some time in 2005.</p>
<p><img src="/image/medicalsv216c.png" alt="Medicals 2.16c"></p>
<p>Version 2 underwent a significant visual overhaul (read: turned buttons into images), a change of identity (that bogus company from previous screenshots had been swapped with yet another bogus one), as well as a few <code>for</code> loops, evident in the “Automate/Batch” section. I have no clue what it did anymore.</p>
<p>One key innovation I thought I implemented at the time was the concept of <em>loading</em>. Many software programs at the time – particularly Microsoft products – had loading screens, which was shown while the software did <em>something</em> behind the scenes.</p>
<p>I also made a loading screen for Medicals. Not before the database was slow, but because I wanted a loading screen. As a result, the loading screen was simply opened and closed according to a timer.</p>
<h2 id="Medicals-2-65-where-the-talking-stops"><a href="#Medicals-2-65-where-the-talking-stops" class="headerlink" title="Medicals 2.65: where the talking stops"></a>Medicals 2.65: where the talking stops</h2><p><img src="/image/2.49.png" alt="Medicals, supposedly version 2.49"></p>
<p>Medicals 2.49 was the last version with a preserved screenshot, and the final version number for the project went as high as 2.65. I discovered something called <em>Visual Basic</em>, which, behold, created real software executables. That, along with whatever reason that prevented databases created by non-English versions of MS Access to be opened elsewhere, ended my plan to ever re-open the archive of mystery that is <code>Medical265.mdb</code>.</p>

    	<p>Startups (start-ups) are hard.</p>
<p>You are the CEO of <em>QuickHolland</em>, a company that sells instant hollandaise sauce (currently in R&amp;D) in revolutionary, squeeze-bottle form factor.</p>
<p>As a founder in a startup, you likely have several priorities to juggle:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Maintaining your vision</strong>, because it is <em>your</em> company</li>
<li><strong>Maintaining investor relations</strong>, to get advice from them (if they are on the board) or to have a constant source of funding</li>
<li><strong>Managing your day-to-day business</strong>, because, again, this company is yours to run.</li>
</ol>
<p>This post explains why it is often difficult to do all of these things.</p>
<h2 id="1-Maintaining-your-vision"><a href="#1-Maintaining-your-vision" class="headerlink" title="1. Maintaining your vision"></a>1. Maintaining your vision</h2><p>Your mother just spent an hour <a href="http://ciaoegrazie.wordpress.com/tag/gordon-ramsays-hollandaise-sauce/" target="_blank" rel="external">making hollandaise sauce from scratch</a>, and she complains to you that it was too time-consuming a thing to do in the morning–when people need to get to work on time.</p>
<p>You have an idea; a lightbulb glowed atop your head. Instant hollandaise sauce. You narrow your vision. You set your goal. You incorporate your company. And you hire on the best people you know.</p>
<p>Now what?</p>
<p><strong>Is it your job to stick to the vision, or is it sometimes appropriate to modify the company’s vision?</strong></p>
<p>One year into your saucy enterprise, you find yourself in a sticky situation, where your food scientists come up with something in a squeeze bottle, but no one is buying it. “But build it and they will come,” you think to yourself, “maybe I am not reaching the correct market.”</p>
<p>You pitch your idea to your investors and they say that your idea reeks of unoriginality. They say that it has been done before. “Is this like other hollandaise sauces out there, except <del>on social networks</del>in a squeeze bottle?” You tell them yes, but, see, the squeeze bottle is what we’re <em>really</em> selling. Your investors, agreeing with your explanation, throw money at you for another year of runway.</p>
<p><strong>Are you now selling hollandaise sauce, or are you now selling squeeze bottles?</strong></p>
<p>You go back to your team of scientists and tell them you have decided to <em>pivot</em>. To pivot is to change the direction of the company–your corporate vision has now changed. Half of your team leaves your company because they are food scientists, not petroleum engineers (who would be the people who commonly make squeeze bottles). “No matter,” you think to yourself, “I have <em>leads</em>.”</p>
<h2 id="2-Maintaining-investor-relations"><a href="#2-Maintaining-investor-relations" class="headerlink" title="2. Maintaining investor relations"></a>2. Maintaining investor relations</h2><p>You own 100% of the company, but you need some initial funding, so the first course of action, of course, is to ask family and friends for your “bootstrap” money. That money buys you time, the ability to pay lawyers and governments for business-related fees, and money to hire your first employee.</p>
<p>Of course, you will almost certainly want to hire more than one employee, so you sell your company’s <em>shares</em>, to your investors (wherever you got hold of them to begin with), for instant funding, paid back by them as <em>convertible notes</em>. With that capital, you hire your second, third, fourth employees, and so on. You know how long your <em>runway</em> is (how much money you have {div} how much money you spend per month), and so do your investors, because they request that kind of information. They give you funding because they know you have a team who can execute your idea. They give you funding because you seem like a competent leader. They give you funding because, ultimately, your company might succeed, which means more money for them.</p>
<p><strong>What if you don’t succeed?</strong></p>
<h2 id="3-Managing-your-day-to-day-business"><a href="#3-Managing-your-day-to-day-business" class="headerlink" title="3. Managing your day-to-day business"></a>3. Managing your day-to-day business</h2><p><em>QuickHolland</em> is your first business, and it is your baby. By now, you have been working on it for three years, and you have pivoted three times so far; your company now prints posters for supermarkets that sell your brilliant squeeze bottles, turning your company into an advertising agency. You still have your brilliant team of people, but only one food scientist is left at this point, because the company isn’t really making food anymore.</p>
<p>On your fourth year, you run out of funding (which is a surprising amount of time, because investors gave you only one year’s worth of money.) You cannot pay your employees for the time being, but, no matter, this too shall pass. You try very hard to look for new investors. You get about half a year worth of runway, yet again, saving the company once more.</p>
<p><strong>Are you going to pay your employees their unsettled wages? If so, how?</strong></p>
<p>Once, while swimming in Salt Lake, you encounter a young, attractive woman, who happens to be interested in you. You two share the same interests, same backgrounds, and quickly fall in love. Once she moves in, You quickly realise that you no longer have the time and patience to run and maintain the company that was once your baby and vision. Hell, it isn’t even what your mother asked for anymore.</p>
<p><strong>What comes first? Your life, or your company?</strong></p>

<figure class="highlight lsl"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre><span class="line">1</span><br></pre></td><td class="code"><pre><span class="line">array = [<span class="number">1</span>, <span class="number">2</span>, <span class="number">3</span>, <span class="number">4</span>, <span class="number">5</span>]  # this is also [<span class="number">1.</span><span class="number">.5</span>], by the way! go CoffeeScript!</span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure>
<p>You can write the same array <em>without</em> the commas that CoffeeScript hates.</p>
<figure class="highlight lsl"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre><span class="line">1</span><br><span class="line">2</span><br><span class="line">3</span><br><span class="line">4</span><br><span class="line">5</span><br><span class="line">6</span><br><span class="line">7</span><br></pre></td><td class="code"><pre><span class="line">array = [  # now this is a CoffeeScript array</span><br><span class="line">    <span class="number">1</span></span><br><span class="line">    <span class="number">2</span></span><br><span class="line">    <span class="number">3</span></span><br><span class="line">    <span class="number">4</span></span><br><span class="line">    <span class="number">5</span></span><br><span class="line">]</span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure>
<p>Why stop there, we can have objects without commas:</p>
<figure class="highlight dts"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre><span class="line">1</span><br><span class="line">2</span><br><span class="line">3</span><br><span class="line">4</span><br><span class="line">5</span><br><span class="line">6</span><br><span class="line">7</span><br></pre></td><td class="code"><pre><span class="line">obj = &#123;</span><br><span class="line"><span class="symbol">    a:</span> <span class="number">1</span></span><br><span class="line"><span class="symbol">    b:</span> <span class="number">2</span></span><br><span class="line"><span class="symbol">    c:</span> <span class="number">3</span></span><br><span class="line"><span class="symbol">    d:</span> <span class="number">4</span></span><br><span class="line"><span class="symbol">    e:</span> <span class="number">5</span></span><br><span class="line">&#125;</span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure>
<p>, which is no surprise. However, did you know:</p>
<figure class="highlight makefile"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre><span class="line">1</span><br><span class="line">2</span><br><span class="line">3</span><br><span class="line">4</span><br><span class="line">5</span><br><span class="line">6</span><br><span class="line">7</span><br></pre></td><td class="code"><pre><span class="line">obj = &#123;  <span class="comment"># not a SyntaxError</span></span><br><span class="line">    a</span><br><span class="line">    b</span><br><span class="line">    c</span><br><span class="line">    d</span><br><span class="line">    e</span><br><span class="line">&#125;</span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure>
<p>and</p>
<figure class="highlight makefile"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre><span class="line">1</span><br><span class="line">2</span><br><span class="line">3</span><br></pre></td><td class="code"><pre><span class="line">obj = &#123;a, b, c, d, e&#125;  <span class="comment"># not a SyntaxError AND not a set!</span></span><br><span class="line"></span><br><span class="line">obj = &#123;a b c d e&#125;  <span class="comment"># not a thing</span></span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure>
<p>Why stop there, we can remove the braces too, because who likes typing braces if you don’t have to?</p>
<figure class="highlight dts"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre><span class="line">1</span><br><span class="line">2</span><br><span class="line">3</span><br><span class="line">4</span><br><span class="line">5</span><br><span class="line">6</span><br></pre></td><td class="code"><pre><span class="line">obj =</span><br><span class="line"><span class="symbol">    a:</span> <span class="number">1</span></span><br><span class="line"><span class="symbol">    b:</span> <span class="number">2</span></span><br><span class="line"><span class="symbol">    c:</span> <span class="number">3</span></span><br><span class="line"><span class="symbol">    d:</span> <span class="number">4</span></span><br><span class="line"><span class="symbol">    e:</span> <span class="number">5</span></span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure>
<p>It’s all well and good until this one turned up</p>
<figure class="highlight makefile"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre><span class="line">1</span><br><span class="line">2</span><br><span class="line">3</span><br><span class="line">4</span><br><span class="line">5</span><br><span class="line">6</span><br></pre></td><td class="code"><pre><span class="line">obj =  <span class="comment"># unexpectedly, you can't omit things whenever you want</span></span><br><span class="line">    a</span><br><span class="line">    b</span><br><span class="line">    c</span><br><span class="line">    d</span><br><span class="line">    e</span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure>
<p>And that is what makes CoffeeScript better for iterative development.</p>
<h2 id="Exercises"><a href="#Exercises" class="headerlink" title="Exercises"></a>Exercises</h2><h3 id="Exercise-1"><a href="#Exercise-1" class="headerlink" title="Exercise 1"></a>Exercise 1</h3><p>What is <code>result</code> for each of these three statements in CoffeeScript?</p>

    	<p>I don’t actually know much about JavaScript development when it comes to npm, grunt, gulp, and volo. They all seemed like… things, to me. Do you have a webapp that handles your models, controllers, and views, but somehow you need static files to be generated using these new workflows, but have no idea how? That’s what I am going through! Here outlines my learnings.</p>
<h1 id="Always-specify-your-path"><a href="#Always-specify-your-path" class="headerlink" title="Always specify your path"></a>Always specify your path</h1><p>Before you do anything in your project, tell <code>npm</code> where to put your packages. This is done by running:</p>
<figure class="highlight routeros"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre><span class="line">1</span><br></pre></td><td class="code"><pre><span class="line"><span class="builtin-name">export</span> <span class="attribute">PATH</span>=node_modules/.bin:$&#123;PATH&#125;</span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure>
<p>Alternatively, investigate in some sort of <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/3653495/is-there-an-virtual-environment-for-node-js" target="_blank" rel="external">virtualenv</a>. If they worked the way Python’s virtualenv did, then it would be the way to go, but I have no success with them.</p>
<h1 id="Tell-npm-to-install-bower-components"><a href="#Tell-npm-to-install-bower-components" class="headerlink" title="Tell npm to install bower components"></a>Tell npm to install bower components</h1><p>The typical workflow consists of the following:</p>
<figure class="highlight cmake"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre><span class="line">1</span><br><span class="line">2</span><br></pre></td><td class="code"><pre><span class="line">npm <span class="keyword">install</span></span><br><span class="line">bowser <span class="keyword">install</span></span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure>
<p>Don’t you think, why run the second command manually if <code>npm</code> could run it for me? That would be correct – this simple configuration in <code>package.json</code> will do the trick.</p>
<figure class="highlight json"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre><span class="line">1</span><br><span class="line">2</span><br><span class="line">3</span><br><span class="line">4</span><br><span class="line">5</span><br></pre></td><td class="code"><pre><span class="line">&#123;</span><br><span class="line">  <span class="attr">"scripts"</span>: &#123;</span><br><span class="line">    <span class="attr">"postinstall"</span>: <span class="string">"bower install"</span></span><br><span class="line">  &#125;</span><br><span class="line">&#125;</span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure>
<h1 id="Install-almost-everything-with-save"><a href="#Install-almost-everything-with-save" class="headerlink" title="Install (almost) everything with --save"></a>Install (almost) everything with <code>--save</code></h1><p>Unlike <code>apt-get</code>, nothing you save with <code>npm</code> and <code>bower</code> will be available to your environment by default. To persist these packages across multiple developer machines, run <code>npm install</code> and <code>bower install</code> with the <code>--save</code> flag, which records the packages you installed into <code>package.json</code> and <code>bower.json</code>, respectively.</p>
<h1 id="Always-do-the-hippest-thing"><a href="#Always-do-the-hippest-thing" class="headerlink" title="Always do the hippest thing"></a>Always do the hippest thing</h1><p>Java has a reputation for having robust, tried-and-true methods for doing everything. Want to run a webapp? Install spring’s jars. Want to install a package? You will probably be using maven. However, in JavaScript development, everything is making a new flavour of everything, where no standard is made and/or obeyed. Ignoring the fact that no one has any idea what is going on, it is also apparent that the only way to stay afloat in the web development community is to use the most recent builds of everything, in order to shorten your dependency tree (example: if you need to use an older version of Backbone, then all other dependencies will install newer versions of Backbone alongside yours).</p>
<p>Never settle for Grunt, because Gulp exists. If Gulp has a newer alternative, then switch to it immediately. There is no such thing as resilience in this field – the only thing you need to do is to accept change.</p>
