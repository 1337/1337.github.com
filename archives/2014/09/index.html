    	<p>Welcome to StartupCompany. In this guide, you will learn what is necessary to work with StartupCompany as a developer.</p>
<ol>
<li>You will be assigned tasks to work on. As our development is results-driven, you will not be given deadlines until the due date.</li>
<li>The business team makes decisions based on the team’s intuition. You will be notified of their intuition when the client demands something.</li>
<li>Often, deadlines may be from an earlier point in time.</li>
<li>We run our in-house Test-Driven Development (TDD). All our tests are currently passing – new team members are expected to write zero tests.</li>
<li>StartupCompany. frequently gives away free trials to customers. The conversion rate of these trials has so far been 0%. Your responsibility is to make these free trials a reality. </li>
<li>As a form of money management, the CEO will pay you with money that will eventually exist in six-month’s time. If there is no money in the bank before the sixth month, you will not be paid.</li>
<li>As an expert in the field, you will be expected to write code that works from IE7 to IE12, including development and debug builds of desktop and mobile browsers. </li>
<li>Every developer is encouraged to document their code and processes. You can find our large repository of outdated docs in our FreeProduct repository. </li>
<li>Here at StartupCompany, we strive for results. Using the Thick Loaves(TM) philosophy, you are encouraged to push code to production every 5 minutes, however stable it is, as long as it is stable. (see point 7)  </li>
<li>Employees are expected to complete tasks in under 50% of the allocated time. </li>
<li>We have many clients, and, as such, have to fulfill requirements from each client. You will be creating marvelous work of art that does all that with just one code base. </li>
<li>You, as a new member at StartupCompany, are very special. We treat you like a team. The whole team.</li>
<li>We use Dipchat as our company issue tracker. If you find a bug, please file it inside the room named ‘Developers’. The bugs that you file will not be resolved; the bugs that you address will not be acknowledged.</li>
<li>The Business team has no technical knowledge related to building and designing a product. As such, if they ask you how long something would take to implement, please work with them and reply with ‘a very short time.’</li>
<li>We are a six year-old company, and we have made a lot of great products in the past. You will be working on a relatively new project that needs to have features from all previous iterations.</li>
<li>After reading about Exception-driven development (EDD) on Hacker News, we have adopted it as a practice. The moral of the story here is that if we monitor our systems, then they will not fail.</li>
</ol>

    	<p>Let me tell you a story about <strong>Medicals</strong>, my personal project from 2004.</p>
<h2 id="Prequel"><a href="#Prequel" class="headerlink" title="Prequel"></a>Prequel</h2><p>I did an educational manoeuvre at around the age of 14. I was an innocent person at the time – so young, so ambitious, yet so full of nothing. My life took a strange turn one day, when the school where I studied decided to give us all a project in Microsoft Access:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Make a form that shows contents of a table. (or something… it was more than a decade ago)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Intuitively, all that a student had to do was to fire up MS Access, create a new database with a form in it, where fields in the form are linked to columns in that table. That would get you 100%. However, being the person that I was, I made such a thing:</p>
<p><img src="/image/sneak_peak_3.jpg" alt="not Medicals"></p>
<p>(The ‘table’ beneath the UI handled expense records, hence the name “Expense”.)</p>
<p>From the screenshot, it was apparent that I made at least 5 iterations of the Expense project.</p>
<p><a href="https://google.com/search?q=David+Kirby" title="I know, I know... it&#39;s a very common name. I can&#39;t find him online, either." target="_blank" rel="external">David Kirby</a>, my ICT (IT) teacher at the time, told me I did a good job.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>I did a good job.</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p>At the age of (a young age), my naivete thought that MS Access was the go-to platform for creating computer interfaces, for realising dreams like others do; ranging from classic address books to entire operating systems, I attempted recreating them all.</p>
<p>FA, Windows 98 in Access!<br><img src="/image/simulator98.png" alt="FA, Windows 98 in Access!"></p>
<p>FA, Windows in Access run on Windows that looks like Mac OS X!<br><img src="/image/simulatormac1.png" alt="FA, Windows in Access run on Windows that looks like Mac OS X!"></p>
<p>FA, Windows XP in Access – it’s even widescreen!<br><img src="/image/simulator23.png" alt="FA, Windows XP in Access -- it&#39;s even widescreen!"></p>
<p>These were all created at the peak of my ignorance. At that age, when the Internet was nothing more than Yahoo! mail, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MSN_Explorer" target="_blank" rel="external">MSN Explorer</a>, and <a href="http://stickdeathreborn.tk" target="_blank" rel="external">stickdeath.com</a>, ignorance is not only bliss–it was my only choice. To make sure you understand how stupid these projects were, everything in the form was an image resource. Each resource points to an image file, which then in turn can be placed on the form. They have pre-written handlers that simply make other elements show and hide.</p>
<p>Then came Medicals.</p>
<h2 id="Medicals-the-early-days"><a href="#Medicals-the-early-days" class="headerlink" title="Medicals: the early days"></a>Medicals: the early days</h2><p>At the height of passionate “software” development, I came up with this ambitious idea while visiting my family doctor, who went by the name of <em>Ng</em>. He was an incompetent wad who happened to be the doctor closest to where my family resided. He had cabinets upon cabinets of patient records that were retrieved by hand. I thought: what if I made something for this guy, who clearly has a need for a computerised system?</p>
<p><img src="/image/medicals.png" alt="Medicals 1.1"></p>
<p><img src="/image/medi13c.png" alt="Medicals 1.3"></p>
<p>Having gained the experience to do stupid things very quickly, Medicals 1.0 (not pictured) was born. The first version, like its predecessors, are merely MS Access forms that link to table entries. However, Medicals 1.3 was a little different. Forms were linked to <em>queries</em> instead, and there was a reporting option, which were <em>reports</em> linked to queries. This allowed the interface to show both information about a particular patient, and a list of medications that was given to the patient (in the image above, the patient was repeatedly given arbitrary doses of Vitamin C).</p>
<p><img src="/image/medi15c2.png" alt="Medicals 1.5"></p>
<p>Medicals 1.5 was “released” in the sense that <code>medicals.mdb</code> was copied elsewhere as <code>medicals15.mdb</code>. From the only surviving screenshot, it can be seen that doctor <em>Ng</em> can now record the number of days for which he prescribed water to the patient.</p>
<h2 id="Medicals-2-where-the-crazy-got-crazier"><a href="#Medicals-2-where-the-crazy-got-crazier" class="headerlink" title="Medicals 2: where the crazy got crazier"></a>Medicals 2: where the crazy got crazier</h2><p>Even a crazy person would, at this point, realise that <em>real</em> people, like a doctor, would not use something, let alone a mission-critical database, from a (young person). However, I was not crazy. I was deranged. I was an energetic, deranged man, who would take this project to the end of its days, until someone, somewhere, actually uses my work for real.</p>
<p>The Medicals 2 series was made “available to the public” some time in 2005.</p>
<p><img src="/image/medicalsv216c.png" alt="Medicals 2.16c"></p>
<p>Version 2 underwent a significant visual overhaul (read: turned buttons into images), a change of identity (that bogus company from previous screenshots had been swapped with yet another bogus one), as well as a few <code>for</code> loops, evident in the “Automate/Batch” section. I have no clue what it did anymore.</p>
<p>One key innovation I thought I implemented at the time was the concept of <em>loading</em>. Many software programs at the time – particularly Microsoft products – had loading screens, which was shown while the software did <em>something</em> behind the scenes.</p>
<p>I also made a loading screen for Medicals. Not before the database was slow, but because I wanted a loading screen. As a result, the loading screen was simply opened and closed according to a timer.</p>
<h2 id="Medicals-2-65-where-the-talking-stops"><a href="#Medicals-2-65-where-the-talking-stops" class="headerlink" title="Medicals 2.65: where the talking stops"></a>Medicals 2.65: where the talking stops</h2><p><img src="/image/2.49.png" alt="Medicals, supposedly version 2.49"></p>
<p>Medicals 2.49 was the last version with a preserved screenshot, and the final version number for the project went as high as 2.65. I discovered something called <em>Visual Basic</em>, which, behold, created real software executables. That, along with whatever reason that prevented databases created by non-English versions of MS Access to be opened elsewhere, ended my plan to ever re-open the archive of mystery that is <code>Medical265.mdb</code>.</p>
