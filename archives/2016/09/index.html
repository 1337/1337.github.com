    	<p>With the number of developers boom from 200 to 6000, Matt Ranney, the chief systems architect,, decided to give a talk about what he wish he knew from scaling up so quickly.</p>
<h1 id="Don’t-make-microservices-for-the-sake-of-making-microservices"><a href="#Don’t-make-microservices-for-the-sake-of-making-microservices" class="headerlink" title="Don’t make microservices for the sake of making microservices"></a>Don’t make microservices for the sake of making microservices</h1><p>Microservices have surprising downsides. </p>
<p>If you are building a lot of them, you start to realise that there is a risk in breaking something whenever they are changed. There is a surprising benefit to not touching a microservice if it works.</p>
<h2 id="Speed"><a href="#Speed" class="headerlink" title="Speed"></a>Speed</h2><p>RPC is always slower than PC, and microservices are all about RPC. At some point, there is a cost to the complexity of RPC as well.</p>
<p>Your function call is now asynchronous.<br>Your function call suddenly needs to understand status codes.<br>Your function call suddenly needs schema validation.</p>
<h2 id="Politics"><a href="#Politics" class="headerlink" title="Politics"></a>Politics</h2><p>If developers don’t like the design decision of something, they might just add a knob, or maybe make their own copy of the same thing that does something differently, so they can keep their biases in how something should be done. The problem: the cost of having different languages in the stack is tremendous.</p>
<p>It is hard to share code between platforms.<br>It is hard to get developer to move between teams.<br>It fragments the development culture (different “beliefs”).</p>
<h1 id="Working-with-repos"><a href="#Working-with-repos" class="headerlink" title="Working with repos"></a>Working with repos</h1><p>There are many correct answer to managing repositories, and “one repo” is not necessarily the wrong answer.<br>Uber has 8000 repositories, mainly developers’ personal ones nevertheless, but some teams also split code repositories from configuration management repositories. </p>
<h1 id="Releasing-things"><a href="#Releasing-things" class="headerlink" title="Releasing things"></a>Releasing things</h1><p>Teams now depend on the services from other teams, so if one team lags behind, so do other teams.<br>They will need to find a compromise in terms of coordinating releases.</p>
<h1 id="Performance"><a href="#Performance" class="headerlink" title="Performance"></a>Performance</h1><h2 id="You-don’t-need-to-know-how-fast-your-thing-is-as-long-as-you-know-it-is-fast-enough"><a href="#You-don’t-need-to-know-how-fast-your-thing-is-as-long-as-you-know-it-is-fast-enough" class="headerlink" title="You don’t need to know how fast your thing is, as long as you know it is fast enough"></a>You don’t need to know how fast your thing is, as long as you know it is fast enough</h2><p>Establish a benchmark performance “SLA” with the teams that use your service, e.g. “this call will definitely complete under 10 seconds”. You know you can take as long as 10 seconds, and you know you won’t need to worry about it until the performance drops below that threshold.</p>
<h2 id="Fanout"><a href="#Fanout" class="headerlink" title="Fanout"></a>Fanout</h2><p>If everyone’s services “tend to be on the slow case”, then the overall service will be slow. That is no good; it is good to establish some sort of distributed tracing, so we can understand why something is slow overall.</p>
<h2 id="Transactions"><a href="#Transactions" class="headerlink" title="Transactions"></a>Transactions</h2><p>“Distributed transactions” in microservice architecture <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/30213456/transactions-across-rest-microservices" target="_blank" rel="external">make no sense</a>. If two things need to be done transactionally, they probably should be in the same microservice.</p>
<h2 id="Dashboards"><a href="#Dashboards" class="headerlink" title="Dashboards"></a>Dashboards</h2><p>All dashboards should be automatically generated. If you don’t do that, all the teams making their own microservices will be making different dashboards that no one understands.<br>Flame graphs are great.</p>
<h1 id="Logging"><a href="#Logging" class="headerlink" title="Logging"></a>Logging</h1><p>Make logging consistent. Don’t log too mush either–logs are not free. Logging can slow down the overall service.</p>
<h1 id="Load-testing"><a href="#Load-testing" class="headerlink" title="Load testing"></a>Load testing</h1><p>You will eventually want a way to load test on production without affecting the metrics that you collect from production.<br>You will need a way to tag “test traffic”.</p>
<h1 id="“Failure-testing”"><a href="#“Failure-testing”" class="headerlink" title="“Failure testing”"></a>“Failure testing”</h1><p>(…)</p>
<h1 id="Migrations"><a href="#Migrations" class="headerlink" title="Migrations"></a>Migrations</h1><p>Migrations sort of have to work before and after they take place. Unfortunately, teams will have to account for that. Fortunately (for Uber), microservices are easier to migrate than monolithic codebases, so they have dodged a bullet there.</p>
<h1 id="Conclusion"><a href="#Conclusion" class="headerlink" title="Conclusion"></a>Conclusion</h1><p>Despite all these helpful tips, Guy concluded with a dark note: “you’ll probably have to learn it to hard way.”</p>

    	<p>Summary of <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/5q69um/how_do_you_subtly_fuck_with_people/" target="_blank" rel="external">this post</a></p>
<ol>
<li>Add keywords like “underwear, car loan, suicide watch” in white font in your emails to get your recipients ad-targeted by them.</li>
<li>“Hey there’s something different about you today, I like it”</li>
<li>When making a multiple choice quiz, make all the correct answers the first one.</li>
<li>Introduce yourself with different names at a party/event.</li>
<li>Slightly rearrange things on someone’s desk.</li>
<li>When reserving a table, name yourself “par par” or “for for”, which forces the waiter/waitress to call out “par par party for two” or “for for for four”.</li>
<li>When answering the phone, answer with “Hi, can I speak to [caller] please”.</li>
<li>Always say “See you tomorrow”, whether or not it is actually going to happen.</li>
<li>End a call or drive-thru with “thanks I love you”.</li>
<li>Bring snacks into the office on April Fool’s day.</li>
<li>Change terms slightly. Game of the Thrones, SnapChap, Los Vegas.</li>
<li>Remember someone’s story, then later tell it back to them as if it happened to you.</li>
<li>Wear a shirt and tie for no reason to work every so often.</li>
<li>When someone asks you if you want something out of courtesy, catch them off guard by actually saying yes. Yes, you would like water.</li>
<li>Reference imaginary famous people in your conversation, and see if anyone notices you made them up.</li>
<li>When someone stops talking, look at them in the eyes until they start talking again.</li>
<li>When someone sneezes, say “thank you” instead of “bless you”. Also works: tell them to shut up, and they will say “thank you” back because they were expecting a “bless you”.</li>
<li>Make up skills for people you barely know. Did you know Maggie can fix watches?</li>
<li>When entering an elevator with people already inside, face them.</li>
<li>“Get them heavily involved in a good conversation, while standing, and just hand them something. Don’t look at it, keep the conversation going, keep eye contact, and hand them anything from a tennis ball to a rock you just picked up. Almost every time they’ll grab it without thinking. Works even better if talking and walking. See how much stuff they can hold.”</li>
<li>“Thanks, you too” to any service industry worker.</li>
<li>Say “to go” when ordering from the drive thru. If you want to make yourself look stupid, “for here” works too.</li>
<li>Claim that you have never heard of a well known country, like Spain.</li>
<li>When people give you a phone to take a group picture, turn around and take a selfie with them.</li>
</ol>

    	<p><strong>tl;dr</strong>: Not much.</p>
<p>While mucking about with my phone in traditional Chinese, I discovered that some of the words in <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.urbandroid.sleep" target="_blank" rel="external">Sleep as Android</a> show up as simplified Chinese. As that is <a href="http://www.scmp.com/comment/blogs/article/1286903/using-simplified-chinese-sin" target="_blank" rel="external">easily an act of war</a>, apparently, I notified the SaA team of this issue.</p>
<p>The reply I got was an invitation to translate the <strong>zh-rTW</strong> strings file for the app. Immediately, I learned (1) that Android’s zh strings suffices have an <code>r</code> before it, whatever it is.</p>
<p>I accepted the invitation. Opening the document, I found that all of the strings are, well, already translated. What gives?</p>
<p>Googling the problem, I found that <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/4189875/simplified-and-traditional-chinese-vs-regions" target="_blank" rel="external"><strong>zh-rHK</strong> is not even an Android locale</a>, and that its existence in CyanogenMod is purely generosity. Well, or so I think. The problem with doing that is <a href="https://github.com/getnikola/nikola/issues/1637" target="_blank" rel="external">zh-rHK actually falls back to zh-rCN</a>, which is simplified Chinese. Blasphemy!</p>
<p>I suggested the SaA team <a href="https://github.com/owncloud/android/tree/master/res/values-zh-rHK" target="_blank" rel="external">copy the zh-rTW file as zh-rHK</a>, so as to maintain the sovereignty of the People’s Republic of Hong Kong. They sent back an updated beta and it was fixed. We did it, Hong Kong!</p>

    	<p><a href="https://xkcd.com/320/" target="_blank" rel="external">One of the first xkcd comics</a> (#320) describes a 28-hour day, where six of such days sum up to 168 hours, which is also what seven 24-hour days add up to. The person would then stay up for 20 hours, sleep eight hours after that, and repeat the process. Of course, ignoring the daylight factor (which, if you have a daylight-dependent sleeping schedule, you would not be reading this in the first place), a person still needs to work, play, planning such a six-day week around the world that revolves around them. What does that look like?</p>
<p><img src="/image/7-day.png" alt=""></p>
<p>If your workplace allows somewhat flexible hours, or if they only specify core hours, then by shifting your Tuesday schedule a bit late, and your Friday schedule a bit early, then you are only 10% deviated from the rest of the world, in a typical 40-hour work week. If the place of employment really wants you to put 40 hours during <em>their</em> workdays, just shift that excel spreadsheet left by four days. Now, you start work two hours early on their Monday, and start two hours late on their Friday. In such a plan, like normal human beings, you will not be working during normal weekends.</p>
<h2 id="What-does-it-look-like-to-you"><a href="#What-does-it-look-like-to-you" class="headerlink" title="What does it look like to you?"></a>What does it look like to you?</h2><p><img src="/image/6-day.png" alt=""></p>
<p>At first, if you commit to centering your life around your sleep, then you get eight hours of sleep at “midnight” every day. The time at which you leave for work will be drastically different every “day”. On day 1 (whatever name you give it), you will work at 10am. On day 4, you will start working at 8pm, finishing at “28pm”, your midnight.</p>
<h2 id="Bonus-exercise-when-do-shops-open"><a href="#Bonus-exercise-when-do-shops-open" class="headerlink" title="Bonus exercise: when do shops open?"></a>Bonus exercise: <em>when do shops open?</em></h2><p>Enough about work. Your life is a lot more than just work. How about food? How about entertainment? When are things open relative to your 6-day week? Well, highlighting the 9am~7pm range, when shops are typically open and available to you?</p>
<p><img src="/image/6-day-ds.png" alt=""></p>
<p>Well, as it turns out, there are not that many hours that you have to shop when both you and other human beings are awake. On most days, you can get away with shopping after work; it might be a bit strange for your “weekend” day, for there are three shopping hours immediately after you wake up, and three more right before you go to bed. No more eight-hour activities for you!</p>

    	<p>The Apple Keynote took place on 2016-09-07. I stayed up all night to catch it, and I must say, I am very impressed. Apple had jam-packed their newest products with new technology, that allow us to do more with our lives. The seven key takeaways are as follows:</p>
<p><img src="/image/apple-iphone.jpg" alt=""></p>
<ol>
<li>The Apple Watch series 2 is the first water-resistant Apple Watch in the world. At just $369, you can track your <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shower" target="_blank" rel="external">everyday swim</a>, using the same battery that offers great battery life of 18 hours when off.</li>
<li>Apple released the world’s first Apple Watch with built-in GPS. The new watch gives owners a second screen on which they may play Pokemon Go, with the iPhone 7 still in the pocket.</li>
<li>The all-new iPhone 7, also released today, is also water-resistant, without the use of a case. Because the glossy black iPhone 7 is manufactured using a <em>precision nine-step anodization and polishing process</em>, <a href="http://www.theverge.com/circuitbreaker/2016/9/7/12836762/iphone-7-announced-black-scratch" target="_blank" rel="external">Apple recommends getting a case.</a></li>
<li>Compared to the previous generation iPhone 6S, the new iPhone 7 offers a better processor, <a href="http://forum.xda-developers.com/oneplus-one/development/mod-oneplus-one-stereo-mod-t2967925" target="_blank" rel="external">stereo speakers</a>, all while adding two more hours of battery life, in addition to a <a href="http://www.theverge.com/circuitbreaker/2016/9/7/12828652/apple-iphone-7-home-button-removed-force-touch" target="_blank" rel="external">solid state home button</a> that is the world’s first on an iPhone.</li>
<li>The earphone jack on the iPhone 7 is now <a href="http://appleplugs.com/" target="_blank" rel="external">replaced</a> with an <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Android/comments/51mv8m/with_the_apple_keynote_finished_what_are_your/d7d5zv2" target="_blank" rel="external"><em>included</em></a> <a href="http://www.macrumors.com/2016/09/07/apple-3-5-mm-jack-lightning-adapter/" target="_blank" rel="external">lightning-to-3.5mm adapter</a>, that lets you listen to music using the iPhone 7. The adapter is $9 from the store. In addition to the adapter, Apple also offers a <a href="http://www.apple.com/shop/product/MMTN2AM/A/earpods-with-lightning-connector" target="_blank" rel="external">$29-pair of earphones that can be plugged directly into the Lightning port.</a> Replacing the 3.5mm jack, lightning cables can also be inserted upside down.</li>
<li>Speaking of wired adapters, wireless is in, and wires are the way to go (except Lightning cables). The AirPods are an impressive breakthrough in wireless earbud technology. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CHCQO4zfkiE" target="_blank" rel="external"><em>Loaded with sensors and filled with so much tech</em></a>, users can listen to music for up to five hours. AirPods are also the first Apple wireless earbuds to feature <a href="http://www.apple.com/airpods/" target="_blank" rel="external">Siri integration</a>, dual internal batteries, and infrared sensors.</li>
<li>Despite being Apple’s cheapest wireless earbuds offering, <a href="http://qz.com/776012/apple-appl-iphone-event-new-wireless-airpod-earbuds-are-most-apple-product-ever/" target="_blank" rel="external">all AirPods come with a free carrying case</a>, that not only keeps the AirPods safe, but also charges Apple’s first pair of earbuds that need to be charged. Unlike everything else released today, neither the AirPods nor the case are resistant to water.</li>
</ol>
<p>All things considered, a very promising Keynote, very good pricing, and an excellent start to Apple’s fiscal quarter. Pre-orders start as soon as next week.</p>
