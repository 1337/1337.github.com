    	<p><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/1g1skk/what_should_i_negotiate_when_buying_a_car/cag03zo" target="_blank" rel="external">Source</a> by /u/tjanderl. Spoiler: sometimes you don’t want to buy a used car.</p>
<p>You need to see it on a lift, remember suspension holds the wheels on and can cost between $1500-$5000 to replace.</p>
<p>To check the shocks and struts: Open car door, stand on the jam, give it a bounce, it should travel down and back up ONCE. if it does anymore the car is riding on springs, this is a $1500 right off the bat, not fixing it will ruin tires and the springs.</p>
<p>Find an area to drive the car in tight circles, listen for any creeking this generally indicates bad ball joints (which can kill you) or bad bushings which will degrade handling significantly.</p>
<p>Look at it on a lift: Almost any component of the suspension that is a joint has a bushing, make sure the plastic bushings are not cracked, make sure any rubber boots are intact as well, a boot is seen where axles meet their wheel/differential, it looks like a rubber accordion and it holds oil to lubricate the joints inside, if they are cracking or damaged the oil will eventually drain and that joint will overheat and seize.</p>
<p>Don’t be afraid to pop the hood, make sure the engine bay is clean, check the oil, pull the dipstick and tap it ever so gently onto a paper towel, the oil will soak in and the dirt will sit on the towel, if there is a lot of dirt sitting on the towel it’s a good bet the oil hasn’t been changed regularly. Make sure fluid levels are OK, some used cars go right to the lot and off fluid levels are signs of improper maintenance. Proper maintenance correlates directly with engine life.</p>
<p>Listen to the engine with the hood open, you don’t want to hear any rhythmic ticking or knocking, you will however hear the mechanical flutter of the valves. No squeals should be heard either.</p>
<p>Speaking of the engine while the car is on the lift inspect any hoses you see, if they are moist and dirty looking the car has been leaking something, be it brake power steering coolant or oil. Leaks are generally cheap fixes but seeing tons of them is a sign the car was poorly maintained.</p>
<p>Inspect the body and underside for rust, non-painted items will rust like the brake rotors etc. This is fine as they are designed to or are eventually maintenance replaced parts, the body shell however shouldn’t be rusting, if it is you’re in for trouble down the line.</p>
<p>Make sure all the electronics in the car work during your test drive, most of all be thorough.</p>
<p>Anything you find wrong (and with used something always will be) is a point where you can talk down the price, don’t worry about having looked at other cars you can still bullshit them by saying “I was looking at a fairly clean and solid civic for X but I like this car more, although I see the bushings are going, that’s a pricey fix can we get that fixed at an X discount before buying?”</p>
<p>If they won’t put it on a lift open the hood or let a mechanic of your choosing inspect the car say no, these are generally crooks who want to sell you a lemon and laugh all the way to the bank.</p>
<p>If you are looking at cars in the $15,000 range you are probably looking at fairly new CPOs, why not just buy a new compact car and ensure the maintenance is done properly from the beginning? You can get a civic in hatch non hatch coupe or sedan in the 17-23 range? The only reason I ask is you honestly don’t save much and can often talk a dealership down when financing a new car to almost where a CPO car is priced, they are less likely to budge down a lot on the price of a CPO or used car, the non-CPO used car market is pay way too much for a piece of shit because cash for clunkers took a lot of good used cars out of existence, as well as parts since all those cars were all scrapped.</p>
<p>Seriously if you buy new and stay dedicated to changing the oil ever 6K miles, tranny fluid 36k and every 18k after, coolant and brake fluid yearly, and power steering with the tranny any modern car will make 100K miles and 6 years without needing serious maintenance, AKA you will pay it off before you start replacing serious parts. Think about a 6 year loan on a new car with 5K down rather than looking at used, just some food for though, if you plan on owning the car for 10 years you’ll be ahead of the pains of a used car.</p>
<p>edit: Seriously consider new, here’s an example of how fucked the used car market is: A ‘99 civic in my area are selling for $8000 with 80k miles, that’s 20K away from cooling system rebuild, timing belt replacement, shock/strut replacement, as well as rotors and drums and most likely not maintained well. A 2010 civic sedan Certified Pre-Owned (CPO) are going for $16,000 with 15-25K miles on the clock, brand new custom ordered and delivered base-package hondas are $18,165. So let’s look at our civic options:</p>
<p>$8000 Civic: About to need roughly $3000 in maintenance in 2 years time, so it’ll cost you 11-12K before you wish you bought a new car…. It’s also going to eat through gas, at 100K you generally loose 3-5 MPG off the sticker and well older cars eat gas anyways. A ‘99 civic will be getting you 17 city and 25 highway. The v-tech has some seals that start to go in it as most variable valve systems do, the ECU adapts but the low-end torque always sucks once the v-tech looses it’s youth, and that’s what you use most unless you do nothing but highway miles.</p>
<p>CPO: 16,000 for a slightly used newer vehicle, chances are you won’t talk them down too far on the price since they put money into it certifying as well as most likely it being a lease someone didn’t want to buy after the terms were up, they probably made 5 grand off it and want to turn a profit on finally getting rid of the thing.</p>
<p>New: 18,000, very negotiable as you can say “Well I was looking at a new subaru that is 17,500 that I like more” and you can really haggle when buying new, plus the dealer makes more off financing a new car than anything else, they’ll take a 2K loss on the car to make 5K back. You could also order the car custom built with your favorite color paint and interior etc. you can make a spreadsheet and maintain the car correctly and get 15 years 250K miles out of it easily, plus all the modern standard amenities like bluetooth aux ports built in nav heated seats and mirrors etc.</p>

<p>Therefore, counting strictly by the number of arrows, it is probably a good idea to have a defensive dark pokemon with a dark move, as well as a ghost type move (shadow ball comes to mind).</p>

    	<p>aka: <a href="https://medium.com/@wob/the-sad-state-of-web-development-1603a861d29f#.q319fwrt8" target="_blank" rel="external">The sad state of web development</a></p>
<p>As part of my investigation to get Google Maps working with an unexploitable API key (hint: <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/38058711/free-google-maps-api-for-hybrid-applications" target="_blank" rel="external">it’s not that easy</a>), I set out my journey to <a href="https://github.com/mapsplugin/cordova-plugin-googlemaps" target="_blank" rel="external">plugins</a> and <a href="http://ionicframework.com/docs/v2/native/google-maps/" target="_blank" rel="external">frameworks</a>, eventually ending up on <a href="http://ionicframework.com/docs/v2/getting-started/installation/" target="_blank" rel="external">the ionic2 installation page</a>, where the project looks mature enough to use.</p>
<p>So, I set up my spanking new ionic project using their own code:</p>
<figure class="highlight mipsasm"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre><div class="line">1</div><div class="line">2</div><div class="line">3</div><div class="line">4</div><div class="line">5</div><div class="line">6</div><div class="line">7</div></pre></td><td class="code"><pre><div class="line">npm <span class="keyword">install </span>-g ionic@<span class="keyword">beta</span></div><div class="line">ionic start foo --v2  <span class="comment"># You will error here</span></div><div class="line">cd foo</div><div class="line">ionic serve</div><div class="line">ionic platform <span class="keyword">add </span><span class="keyword">android</span></div><div class="line">ionic <span class="keyword">build </span><span class="keyword">android </span>--release</div><div class="line">adb <span class="keyword">install </span>-r thing.apk</div></pre></td></tr></table></figure>
<p>The app took, oh, I don’t know, <strong>9 seconds</strong> to start. (Later diagnosis reveals Cordova taking 3 seconds alone, and all <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/28090053/how-to-remove-crosswalk-from-a-cordova-project" target="_blank" rel="external">Crosswalk</a> did for Android 5+ was add bulk to the apk, which is expected behaviour.)<br>The app used 150MB of my Nexus 4’s memory.<br>The app contained a 3-Megabyte <code>app.bundle.js</code>, none of which was readable code.</p>
<p>Seems like a nice new platform to get my hands dirty.</p>

<p>Once I was eleven years old, my father told me,<br>“Go read yourself a [rich dad poor dad book] (or you’ll die poorly).”<br>Once I was eleven years old</p>
<p>I always had that dream, like my father before me<br>So I started picking stocks, I started getting degrees<br>Something about that glory just always seemed to bore me<br>‘Cause only those I really love will ever really know me</p>

<p>“Don’t be trapped with a girl before you establish your career”<br>“Smart guy controls his pennis (<em>sic</em>) with his brian (<em>sic</em>) rather the vice versa”<br>I got my boys with me, at least those in favor<br>And if we don’t meet before I leave, I hope I’ll see you later</p>

<p>The first thing these games do is set up a virtual currency so that it doesn’t feel like you’re spending real currency, even though you are.</p>

<p>Ask users to buy “coins” and “gold” with credit card, and never make the conversion rate easy, like 1 gold: 1 cent. Make it hard for the user to realise how much was actually spent.</p>

<p>People find it harder to spend money when they’re paying in cash than if they’re using a card.</p>

<p>Require users to pay with a credit card, and force the card to be saved. This makes the user easier to spend money for subsequent impulse buys.<br>Apparently, tourist attractions also do this, because they hold foreign currency with an unfamiliar value.</p>

<p>If incense costs 80 pokecoins and a batch of 550 pokecoins costs $4.99, how much real money does incense cost? Yeah i don’t know either.</p>

<p>It is hard to determine the amount of money spent <em>and</em> the amount of virtual currency being spent, making micropayments seem virtual to stupid users.<br>Paying with virtual currency also has the advantage of bypassing the credit card.</p>

<p>Some in-game items are purely gambling. Users will convince themselves than spending 880 Nexon cash (or whatever it’s called) is a good idea for buying a <a href="https://maplewiki.net/index.php?title=Gachapon" target="_blank" rel="external">“Gachapon”</a>, a lottery service that may or may not yield an in-game item more valuable than 880 currency units.</p>

Pay to lure more pokemon, pay to save progress at any time, pay to get a slightly better weapon. The game can still be played without payments, but it seems to users that they can simply pay to wipe the pain away.</p>
