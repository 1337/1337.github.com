    	<p>(Title ripped directly from <a href="https://theshoregriefcenter.wordpress.com/2014/01/15/10-things-crutches-have-taught-me/" target="_blank" rel="external">this post</a>.)</p>
<p>I went skiing last Christmas, and the mountains had claimed my knee (<a href="http://orthoinfo.aaos.org/topic.cfm?topic=a00549" target="_blank" rel="external">some ligaments don’t grow back by themselves</a>, apparently). A group of wonderful friends endured the ordeal with me, an experience I will never forget (medal winners were Jill, Joel, Sultan, and Thomas; special mentions go to family and the government.)</p>
<p>Knee’s useless now. Crutches are in order. Got a pair from the hospital. The last two days were the most physically challenging time of my life.</p>
<h2 id="You-don’t-have-two-arms-when-you-have-two-legs"><a href="#You-don’t-have-two-arms-when-you-have-two-legs" class="headerlink" title="You don’t have two arms when you have two legs"></a>You don’t have two arms when you have two legs</h2><p>Want to walk? Use crutches. How are you using the crutches? With both hands. What can you do while both hands are occupied? Nothing. Even the simplest things can be near impossible to do:</p>
<ul>
<li>Carrying a glass of water to another room</li>
<li>Carrying a plate of food</li>
<li>Carrying anything requiring hands up/down the stairs</li>
<li>Entering a shower</li>
<li>Standing in a shower</li>
<li>Showering</li>
<li>Putting on socks</li>
<li>Wiping (who’s going to help you now?)</li>
</ul>
<p>So, in a sense, by losing a knee, you lose three limbs. Very interesting experience indeed.</p>
<h2 id="People-will-help-you"><a href="#People-will-help-you" class="headerlink" title="People will help you"></a>People will help you</h2><p>And you should accept their offers. No more self reliance and I-can-do-everything attitude, because now you genuinely need the help. Maybe you need a stool. Maybe you need a pillow. Maybe you cannot find your crutches. Maybe you need help getting into a car. Remember you are no longer the person you were, but you are not useless just yet. <em>Accept the help.</em></p>
<h2 id="People-around-you-will-suddenly-be-more-aware-of-accessibility"><a href="#People-around-you-will-suddenly-be-more-aware-of-accessibility" class="headerlink" title="People around you will suddenly be more aware of accessibility"></a>People around you will suddenly be more aware of accessibility</h2><p>Which is a good thing. Not until now had I thought those automatic door buttons being extremely slow being brilliant design. If they opened any faster, you wouldn’t be able to dodge the swinging doors.</p>
<h2 id="They-will-mistake-crutches-for-canes"><a href="#They-will-mistake-crutches-for-canes" class="headerlink" title="They will mistake crutches for canes"></a>They will mistake crutches for canes</h2><p>Sometimes you simply cannot walk with just one crutch, as is the case when the bad leg cannot bear any load.<br>Canes are for people with two functional (but weak) legs. If you take a crutch from me, I can only hop on my good leg.</p>
<h2 id="You-are-not-alone-there-are-many-people-just-like-you"><a href="#You-are-not-alone-there-are-many-people-just-like-you" class="headerlink" title="You are not alone; there are many people just like you"></a>You are not alone; there are many people just like you</h2><p>And because of that, outside your own place of dwelling, it is actually not that bad. Any form of official building would have a code that requires a level of accessibility to be taken into account. You legitimately qualify for the handicap (“people who identify with disability”, according to Ryerson’s Ted Rogers School of Management) washrooms now. You can use the lift/elevator for one single floor, without being perceived as a douche. I have not tried this yet, but shopping malls have scooters that are designed for people like us/you, and/or the morbidly obese.</p>
<h2 id="Healing-takes-a-long-time"><a href="#Healing-takes-a-long-time" class="headerlink" title="Healing takes a long time"></a>Healing takes a <em>long</em> time</h2><p>And you should not rush it. Trying to bend the knee will make it worse (in my case, anyway). Trying to stand on the bad leg will also make it worse, often permanently. There is no need to rush it recovery, because it is happening as quickly as you let it.</p>
<h2 id="You-can-use-the-crutch-like-a-stick"><a href="#You-can-use-the-crutch-like-a-stick" class="headerlink" title="You can use the crutch like a stick"></a><em>You</em> can use the crutch like a stick</h2><p>Unlike normal people using a crutch like a stick, <em>you</em> using the crutch like a stick is seen as an advantage; a clever idea. People with legs poking light switches from their seats is just being lazy.</p>
<h2 id="Exercise-whenever-you-can"><a href="#Exercise-whenever-you-can" class="headerlink" title="Exercise whenever you can"></a>Exercise whenever you can</h2><p>Muscle loss will occur immediately after the injury. Consult with a physiotherapist to see what kinds of exercise you can do, and how often you can do them.</p>
<h2 id="Don’t-go-to-work"><a href="#Don’t-go-to-work" class="headerlink" title="Don’t go to work"></a>Don’t go to work</h2><p>What are you, insane? Going to work not only increases the chances of you hurting yourself, you will also delay healing by inducing additional stress (pointed out by a mate who goes by “YS”.) If you can work from home, then you don’t need to move. Win. If you cannot work from home, then the company cannot fire you for not working (but they can do so for other reasons). Also win.</p>
<h2 id="“It-only-gets-better-from-here”-is-not-true"><a href="#“It-only-gets-better-from-here”-is-not-true" class="headerlink" title="“It only gets better from here” is not true"></a>“It only gets better from here” is not true</h2><p>Just because an injury is acute, but it doesn’t mean things will only get better. For example, an injury to the knee significantly increases the chance of that same knee developing arthritis, especially so for the case if you try to use the bad knee before it fully recovers. <em>If you don’t take good care of yourself, no one will.</em></p>

    	<p>I believe everyone should learn something every day. Here is what I learned every so often.</p>
<h1 id="Working-with-yourself"><a href="#Working-with-yourself" class="headerlink" title="Working with yourself"></a>Working with yourself</h1><h2 id="Keep-a-journal"><a href="#Keep-a-journal" class="headerlink" title="Keep a journal"></a>Keep a journal</h2><p>Chances are, you won’t remember everything.<br>Keep a journal. For work. For home. For your personal life (sometimes known as a diary).<br>Write down what you did that day, and what you learned that day.<br>Not only does that help you remember everything, it helps you hold yourself accountable, too.</p>
<h2 id="Remember-what-people-said"><a href="#Remember-what-people-said" class="headerlink" title="Remember what people said"></a>Remember what people said</h2><p>People tell you things all the time. Then they expect you to remember everything.<br>Chances are, you won’t remember everything.<br>What down what people say. Later, you can find out why something was done this way or not this way, and hold them accountable, too.</p>
<h2 id="Know-what-people-do-in-the-company"><a href="#Know-what-people-do-in-the-company" class="headerlink" title="Know what people do in the company"></a>Know what people do in the company</h2><p>It will eventually come to you that not everyone in your company is a developer, and they all do different things. They all <em>want</em> different things out of their jobs, and they have different objectives to what they do.<br>You should observe what they do, know the things they pay close attention to, and learn from them.</p>
<h2 id="Memorise-the-org-chart"><a href="#Memorise-the-org-chart" class="headerlink" title="Memorise the org chart"></a>Memorise the org chart</h2><p>It is rarely wise to let others tell you what to do, when they aren’t in your department.<br>This is less important in a startup, of course, but remember, no one budgeted your sprint time for other departments’ activities.<br>Likewise (37), if someone higher up messages you directly, there is no hard requirement for you to respond directly, either (though you should).</p>
<h2 id="There’s-no-point-if-you-aren’t-the-best"><a href="#There’s-no-point-if-you-aren’t-the-best" class="headerlink" title="There’s no point if you aren’t the best"></a>There’s no point if you aren’t the best</h2><p>No one hired you to be mediocre. Therefore, only only must you be the best, you must be <em>your</em> best.</p>
<h2 id="Log-your-sick-and-vacation-days"><a href="#Log-your-sick-and-vacation-days" class="headerlink" title="Log your sick (and vacation) days"></a>Log your sick (and vacation) days</h2><p>Everyone should be keeping track of themselves.<br>Eliminate the means of your company screwing you over on paid days off.</p>
<h2 id="Make-friends"><a href="#Make-friends" class="headerlink" title="Make friends"></a>Make friends</h2><p>On a personal level, you will want to build relationships with the people who work with you.<br>A happy colleague is a happy you.</p>
<h2 id="If-it-isn’t-difficult-it-isn’t-worth-doing"><a href="#If-it-isn’t-difficult-it-isn’t-worth-doing" class="headerlink" title="If it isn’t difficult, it isn’t worth doing"></a>If it isn’t difficult, it isn’t worth doing</h2><p>You learn only by challenging yourselves. Being an accountant for a decade doesn’t make you better at making spreadsheets than one who’s fresh out of college.<br>Use your time wisely. When it comes to problem selection, choose the hard ones.</p>
<h2 id="Leave-your-comfort-zone"><a href="#Leave-your-comfort-zone" class="headerlink" title="Leave your comfort zone"></a>Leave your comfort zone</h2><p>Work on other projects. <a href="/2016/How-to-learn-how-to-learn/">Start small. The most important thing is to start, and don’t give up until you finish.</a></p>
<h2 id="Help-out"><a href="#Help-out" class="headerlink" title="Help out"></a>Help out</h2><p>When people need help, that means the problem is either hard (in which you can learn), or easy (for which you earn respect.) It’s a win-win.<br>(Or they’re trying to waste your time with mundane things. Need to watch out for that.)</p>
<h2 id="Expand-your-horizons"><a href="#Expand-your-horizons" class="headerlink" title="Expand your horizons"></a>Expand your horizons</h2><p>The world doesn’t just do what you do; go out there and learn some stuff. If you know C++, learn Java.</p>
<h2 id="Excel-in-your-territory"><a href="#Excel-in-your-territory" class="headerlink" title="Excel in your territory"></a>Excel in your territory</h2><p>“Be good at what you do” should be your baseline.<br>“Be the best at what you do” should be your benchmark.<br>“Be the best at what everyone else does” should be your life goal.</p>
<h2 id="If-you-don’t-know-something-ask"><a href="#If-you-don’t-know-something-ask" class="headerlink" title="If you don’t know something, ask"></a>If you don’t know something, ask</h2><p>Asking questions almost always means you get a better idea at something, especially outside your area of expertise.<br>Also, asking questions, much like a favour, makes people like you. This is a form of social engineering.</p>
<h2 id="Don’t-wait-until-something-becomes-a-problem"><a href="#Don’t-wait-until-something-becomes-a-problem" class="headerlink" title="Don’t wait until something becomes a problem"></a>Don’t wait until something becomes a problem</h2><p>Whatever you built inevitably has bugs (unless you did write 10000 tests for every line of code, which is not unheard of.) Some bugs are merged with the expectation that they are never considered a use case for the feature.<br>If you have time, close those holes. You don’t want someone to hack you one day.</p>
<h2 id="Don’t-let-production-users-find-your-bugs-15"><a href="#Don’t-let-production-users-find-your-bugs-15" class="headerlink" title="Don’t let production users find your bugs (15)"></a>Don’t let production users find your bugs (15)</h2><p>Knowingly pushing buggy code, knowing there is a deadline, should not be part of your work culture.<br>Once you show your users buggy code, there is no way to undo that mistake.</p>
<p><strong>Counter argument</strong>: “If a flag can get it done let’s get it done. Launching is the best way to find problems to fix” (29)</p>
<h2 id="Be-ready-to-fix-things-on-production-42"><a href="#Be-ready-to-fix-things-on-production-42" class="headerlink" title="Be ready to fix things on production (42)"></a>Be ready to fix things on production (42)</h2><p>Production services should never have errors. One advantage of being in an error-free state is the error emails that you (must set up, and) receive will be actual errors that you must fix, so you don’t simply filter them away.</p>
<h2 id="Implement-to-the-spec-17"><a href="#Implement-to-the-spec-17" class="headerlink" title="Implement to the spec (17)"></a>Implement to the spec (17)</h2><p>Once a spec is done, whatever is within the spec, you do exactly what the spec says. <em>The only parts within your control is that which is not written down.</em></p>
<h2 id="“If-you-are-given-your-own-job-would-you-take-it-”"><a href="#“If-you-are-given-your-own-job-would-you-take-it-”" class="headerlink" title="“If you are given your own job, would you take it?”"></a>“If you are given your own job, would you take it?”</h2><p>To do a good job, you must like what you do. If you are offered your own job right now, and you don’t want to take it, then you are probably both in a bad job, and doing a bad job.</p>
<h1 id="Working-with-code"><a href="#Working-with-code" class="headerlink" title="Working with code"></a>Working with code</h1><h2 id="Write-tests"><a href="#Write-tests" class="headerlink" title="Write tests"></a>Write tests</h2><p>Tests can sometimes save you back more time than the time you spend writing them.<br>Well, depends on how the code was written, anyway. More about testable code later.</p>
<h2 id="Make-small-tasks-for-yourself-2"><a href="#Make-small-tasks-for-yourself-2" class="headerlink" title="Make small tasks for yourself (2)"></a>Make small tasks for yourself (2)</h2><p>Break your tasks into smaller, understandable pieces.</p>
<p>Someone might come to you and say, “build me this.”<br>When “this” is a huge endeavour, you will be overwhelmed by the requirements and deadline planning. You don’t actually know what “this” entails.</p>
<h2 id="Make-a-feature-branch-if-the-task-is-big-47"><a href="#Make-a-feature-branch-if-the-task-is-big-47" class="headerlink" title="Make a feature branch if the task is big (47)"></a>Make a feature branch if the task is big (47)</h2><p>A task can be so large that requires collaboration among developers in near real time.<br>In that case, it is probably better to work on a branch, pushing directly to it, and submit the final product for review, rather than submitting each individual change, which the QA must test one by one.</p>
<h2 id="Tests-will-fail"><a href="#Tests-will-fail" class="headerlink" title="Tests will fail"></a>Tests will fail</h2><p>And not only will they fail, they will be hard to fix. The 1/100/10000 rule states that for every second of code you write, you will spend 100 seconds writing tests, and 10000 more wondering why they don’t all pass. </p>
<h2 id="Make-small-changes"><a href="#Make-small-changes" class="headerlink" title="Make small changes"></a>Make small changes</h2><p>No one wants to read big changes. No one wants to test big changes.<br>When you make a big change, QA will ignore you until all other changes are merged.<br>So then you’ll have to rebase.<br>And get code reviews done, all over again.<br>Make small changes.</p>
<h2 id="Other-people’s-tech-debt-are-yours…"><a href="#Other-people’s-tech-debt-are-yours…" class="headerlink" title="Other people’s tech debt are yours…"></a>Other people’s tech debt are yours…</h2><p>If my experience is anything to go by, then I can say for certain that only you will care about technical debt.<br>Overestimate your stories so you get time to recover from the chronic debt.</p>
<p>If you happen to be a project lead, the tech debt you <em>allow</em> into your code base become yours, too. Make careful decisions before you approve or disapprove a change (45).</p>
<h2 id="…And-tech-debt-can-kill-you"><a href="#…And-tech-debt-can-kill-you" class="headerlink" title="…And tech debt can kill you"></a>…And tech debt can kill you</h2><p>After a lot of technical debt, you will start to develop mental issues. You will burn out and require actual medical care.<br>Do not ignore burnout! Take care of yourself first. Work isn’t everything.</p>
<h2 id="Users-are-stupid"><a href="#Users-are-stupid" class="headerlink" title="Users are stupid"></a>Users are stupid</h2><p>And they always, always overestimate their intelligence. There is an art to implementing unassuming UX, and you have not mastered it yet.</p>

This can cause anxiety at first. This activates the area associated with pain in the brain.</p>
<p>Your brain looks for a way to stop that negative feeling by switching your attention to something else more pleasant.</p>
<p><strong>The solution is to just start.</strong> Researchers discovered that not long after people start actually working out what they didn’t like, that neuro-discomfort disappeared. Remember that the better you get at something, the more enjoyable it can become.</p>
<p>Sleep is very important. Exercising produces new neurons, so it is also very important.</p>
<h1 id="Learning-effectively"><a href="#Learning-effectively" class="headerlink" title="Learning effectively"></a>Learning effectively</h1><p>Learn through association, and many concepts will become one, occupying “one memory”. This allows you to learn more.</p>
<p>Turn off distractions, solve problems, and recall without looking at the material. <strong>Repetition is key.</strong> Test yourself as necessary.</p>
<p>Use a familiar place (like the blueprint of your house) and associate visual images of things you want to remember with physical places.</p>

<p>They just make the language and the standard library; they don’t know your use cases.</p>
<p>One time, a kind of averaging function made it into the standard library. It calculated the average to a billion digits of precision.</p>
<p>Well, as it turns out, that sort of precision isn’t meaningful to anyone using that function, so time is simply wasted calculating it.<br>If it is slow, then people won’t use it.<br>If no one will use it, then why is it in the standard library?</p>
<h1 id="Python-should-be-more-friendly-and-he-could-not-count-the-ways"><a href="#Python-should-be-more-friendly-and-he-could-not-count-the-ways" class="headerlink" title="Python should be more friendly, and he could not count the ways"></a>Python should be more friendly, and he could not count the ways</h1><p>Throw a timestamp into a <code>datetime</code> function, and it says <code>Expected a frggn buffer object</code>. What does that even mean? You (the ordinary person) can definitely write more meaningful exception messages for the standard library.</p>
<p>How much better would it be, and how much time would it save everyone, if every error had a format like</p>
<figure class="highlight cs"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre><span class="line">1</span><br><span class="line">2</span><br><span class="line">3</span><br></pre></td><td class="code"><pre><span class="line">Cannot <span class="keyword">do</span> <span class="keyword">this</span> because x</span><br><span class="line">Often caused <span class="keyword">by</span> y</span><br><span class="line">Can be <span class="keyword">fixed</span> <span class="keyword">by</span> z</span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure>
<p>That helps everyone, especially beginners.</p>
<h1 id="The-language-is-25-years-old"><a href="#The-language-is-25-years-old" class="headerlink" title="The language is 25+ years old"></a>The language is 25+ years old</h1><p><code>list()</code> works on a <code>file</code> but not on <code>StringIO</code>. Why is that? It is not intentional; the developers just didn’t have the time to add an equivalent to <code>StringIO</code>. If you want to help, this is one thing you can do. </p>
<h1 id="Help-update-the-docs"><a href="#Help-update-the-docs" class="headerlink" title="Help update the docs"></a>Help update the docs</h1><p>There are still parts of the standard library that are lacking docstrings. If you can <em>accurately</em> document these libraries, by all means!</p>
<h1 id="Every-time-you-submit-even-a-trivial-“fix”-it-takes-core-devs-an-enormous-amount-of-time"><a href="#Every-time-you-submit-even-a-trivial-“fix”-it-takes-core-devs-an-enormous-amount-of-time" class="headerlink" title="Every time you submit even a trivial “fix”, it takes core devs an enormous amount of time"></a>Every time you submit even a trivial “fix”, it takes core devs an enormous amount of time</h1><p>Just because you (the new developer) think something looks off, it doesn’t mean it should be “fixed”.<br>One example of such a story he told was someone changing all unit tests doing <code>assert ... &gt; ...</code> to <code>self.assertGreater(..., ...)</code>. Unbeknownst to the dude, some of these tests are actually supposed to test the bitwise shift operator (<code>&gt;</code>), making some of the tests useless.<br>He also cautioned against refactoring other people’s tests. While code has tests to guard against mistakes, tests themselves do not, especially when some code was red-green developed, and refactoring the tests can potentially reduce the test coverage, or even give out false results.</p>
<h1 id="It-is-pronounced-the-tupple"><a href="#It-is-pronounced-the-tupple" class="headerlink" title="It is pronounced the tupple"></a>It is pronounced the <em>tupple</em></h1><p>At least he’s saying it that way.</p>
<h1 id="Advice-for-new-developers"><a href="#Advice-for-new-developers" class="headerlink" title="Advice for new developers"></a>Advice for new developers</h1><p>If you want to help, go do code reviews on the (Python) bug tracker or PEPs. </p>
<p>PEPs and bug trackers need critical thinking (i.e. knowing why something should not be implemented, rather than why something should).</p>
<p>Every Python feature request should result in a net reduction in complexity. It is easy to implement something. It is hard—extremely hard—to justify not implement it. </p>
<p>Work with developers who talk more about what they don’t know than what they do know. </p>
<p>If you learn without getting the impact, you’re working out wrong.</p>
<p>Understand what problems people are trying to solve, not what frameworks people are throwing at them all day long. </p>

<h1 id="“Well-made-microservices-can-be-rebuilt-in-a-day”"><a href="#“Well-made-microservices-can-be-rebuilt-in-a-day”" class="headerlink" title="“Well-made microservices can be rebuilt in a day”"></a>“Well-made microservices can be rebuilt in a day”</h1><p>The difference between services and microservices is that microservices only take care of one thing. If a service takes care of more than one thing, then it becomes harder to manage.</p>
<p>Microservices also tend to share the same standardised interface, which also help with managing them.</p>
<p>Example interface: REST</p>
<h1 id="A-simple-microservice"><a href="#A-simple-microservice" class="headerlink" title="A simple microservice"></a>A simple microservice</h1><p>A simple microservice consists of:</p>
<ul>
<li>A shared “service base”, where all the boilerplate code is stored,</li>
<li>Service implementation, and</li>
<li>Protocol handler.</li>
</ul>
<h1 id="Database"><a href="#Database" class="headerlink" title="Database"></a>Database</h1><p>None of the microservices will share the same database table.</p>
<p>If microservice A wants something from table B, it will ask microservice B for the information.</p>
<p>None of the microservices will share the same database table. <strong>This makes migrations massively easier to create, rollback, and squash.</strong> Having none of the microservices share the same table also means these tables can be taken out of the database with no difficulty, and can be scaled up using another instance very quickly.</p>
<h2 id="Foreign-keys"><a href="#Foreign-keys" class="headerlink" title="Foreign keys"></a>Foreign keys</h2><p>There will be no foreign keys. The code must manage the integrity.</p>
<h1 id="Error-handling"><a href="#Error-handling" class="headerlink" title="Error handling"></a>Error handling</h1><p>All microservice interfaces must be hard and well-defined.<br>If microservice A calls microservice B calls microservice C, and C raises an error (e.g. HTTP 500), then B must first catch all exceptions, and decide for itself whether to retry calling microservice C, or fail itself to microservice A as well.</p>
<p>Under no circumstance should microservice A receive any uncaught exceptions from microservice C.</p>
<h1 id="Logging"><a href="#Logging" class="headerlink" title="Logging"></a>Logging</h1><p>Request logging is going to be easier per-microservice, but these logs themselves will make no sense. So, <strong>service request logs</strong> should be a thing.</p>
<p>Service Request Logs are trees of logs gathered to serve a single (web) request.</p>
<p>Having these logs also helps with performance tracking, to troubleshoot which microservices fail more often than expected.</p>
<h1 id="Justification-for-microservices"><a href="#Justification-for-microservices" class="headerlink" title="Justification for microservices"></a>Justification for microservices</h1><p>Use microservice architecture if</p>
<ul>
<li>you have multiple clients (or demos)</li>
<li>you have many developers, so they don’t need to rebase over each other’s stuff, or fight to merge into HEAD</li>
<li>you need to keep codebase complexity down, once and for all..</li>
</ul>
<h1 id="Arguments-against-microservices"><a href="#Arguments-against-microservices" class="headerlink" title="Arguments against microservices"></a><a href="https://dzone.com/articles/microservices-please-dont?oid=hn" target="_blank" rel="external">Arguments against microservices</a></h1><ul>
<li>Microservice code is cleaner only if your developers have the ability to write proper code. “Normal services” already encourage cleaner code, if developers have discipline.</li>
<li>Distributed services are never easy. Distributed transactions are even harder. No one will recover these errors for you, so you will need to manage each and every case.</li>
<li>Microservices are always slower than pure function calls, or a lower-numbered, normal services. If you want speed, try another language.</li>
<li>Testing microservices is easy. Testing integration among microservices just became massively more difficult.</li>
