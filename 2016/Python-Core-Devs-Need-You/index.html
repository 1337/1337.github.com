    	<p>Part of the PyCon series, paraphrasing whatever Raymond Hettinger said that day.</p>
<h1 id="The-core-developers-are-not-normal-human-beings"><a href="#The-core-developers-are-not-normal-human-beings" class="headerlink" title="The core developers are not normal human beings"></a>The core developers are not normal human beings</h1><p><em>And they need to hear from you.</em></p>
<p>They just make the language and the standard library; they don’t know your use cases.</p>
<p>One time, a kind of averaging function made it into the standard library. It calculated the average to a billion digits of precision.</p>
<p>Well, as it turns out, that sort of precision isn’t meaningful to anyone using that function, so time is simply wasted calculating it.<br>If it is slow, then people won’t use it.<br>If no one will use it, then why is it in the standard library?</p>
<h1 id="Python-should-be-more-friendly-and-he-could-not-count-the-ways"><a href="#Python-should-be-more-friendly-and-he-could-not-count-the-ways" class="headerlink" title="Python should be more friendly, and he could not count the ways"></a>Python should be more friendly, and he could not count the ways</h1><p>Throw a timestamp into a <code>datetime</code> function, and it says <code>Expected a frggn buffer object</code>. What does that even mean? You (the ordinary person) can definitely write more meaningful exception messages for the standard library.</p>
<p>How much better would it be, and how much time would it save everyone, if every error had a format like</p>
<figure class="highlight cs"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre><span class="line">1</span><br><span class="line">2</span><br><span class="line">3</span><br></pre></td><td class="code"><pre><span class="line">Cannot <span class="keyword">do</span> <span class="keyword">this</span> because x</span><br><span class="line">Often caused <span class="keyword">by</span> y</span><br><span class="line">Can be <span class="keyword">fixed</span> <span class="keyword">by</span> z</span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure>
<p>That helps everyone, especially beginners.</p>
<h1 id="The-language-is-25-years-old"><a href="#The-language-is-25-years-old" class="headerlink" title="The language is 25+ years old"></a>The language is 25+ years old</h1><p><code>list()</code> works on a <code>file</code> but not on <code>StringIO</code>. Why is that? It is not intentional; the developers just didn’t have the time to add an equivalent to <code>StringIO</code>. If you want to help, this is one thing you can do. </p>
<h1 id="Help-update-the-docs"><a href="#Help-update-the-docs" class="headerlink" title="Help update the docs"></a>Help update the docs</h1><p>There are still parts of the standard library that are lacking docstrings. If you can <em>accurately</em> document these libraries, by all means!</p>
<h1 id="Every-time-you-submit-even-a-trivial-“fix”-it-takes-core-devs-an-enormous-amount-of-time"><a href="#Every-time-you-submit-even-a-trivial-“fix”-it-takes-core-devs-an-enormous-amount-of-time" class="headerlink" title="Every time you submit even a trivial “fix”, it takes core devs an enormous amount of time"></a>Every time you submit even a trivial “fix”, it takes core devs an enormous amount of time</h1><p>Just because you (the new developer) think something looks off, it doesn’t mean it should be “fixed”.<br>One example of such a story he told was someone changing all unit tests doing <code>assert ... &gt; ...</code> to <code>self.assertGreater(..., ...)</code>. Unbeknownst to the dude, some of these tests are actually supposed to test the bitwise shift operator (<code>&gt;</code>), making some of the tests useless.<br>He also cautioned against refactoring other people’s tests. While code has tests to guard against mistakes, tests themselves do not, especially when some code was red-green developed, and refactoring the tests can potentially reduce the test coverage, or even give out false results.</p>
<h1 id="It-is-pronounced-the-tupple"><a href="#It-is-pronounced-the-tupple" class="headerlink" title="It is pronounced the tupple"></a>It is pronounced the <em>tupple</em></h1><p>At least he’s saying it that way.</p>
<h1 id="Advice-for-new-developers"><a href="#Advice-for-new-developers" class="headerlink" title="Advice for new developers"></a>Advice for new developers</h1><p>If you want to help, go do code reviews on the (Python) bug tracker or PEPs. </p>
<p>PEPs and bug trackers need critical thinking (i.e. knowing why something should not be implemented, rather than why something should).</p>
<p>Every Python feature request should result in a net reduction in complexity. It is easy to implement something. It is hard—extremely hard—to justify not implement it. </p>
<p>Work with developers who talk more about what they don’t know than what they do know. </p>
<p>If you learn without getting the impact, you’re working out wrong.</p>
<p>Understand what problems people are trying to solve, not what frameworks people are throwing at them all day long. </p>
