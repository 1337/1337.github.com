    	<p>There is <a href="http://ecomodder.com/forum/EM-hypermiling-driving-tips-ecodriving.php" target="_blank" rel="external">a list of tips from hypermilers</a>, each one more ridiculous than the last. The list gets longer every day (108 at this point).<br>But, hey, why stop there?</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Replace your windows with thinner glass</strong><br>The only point of windows is to reduce drag. Replace them with plastic windows, which are significantly lighter. Why not? <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lamborghini_Sesto_Elemento" target="_blank" rel="external">Everyone is doing it.</a></li>
<li><strong>Tape the gaps between the doors you don’t use</strong><br>Tape your doors shut, so air does not get trapped between the door and the gaps. Top gear did it in Ukraine once, obtaining insane MPG figures.</li>
<li><strong>Strip your paint off, and replace with golf balls</strong><br>The average car carries “200 pounds” of paint (whichever pound it is). That’s a lot! Strip everything off, and replace the surface with the golf ball pattern, which <a href="http://www.franklygolf.com/golf-ball-aerodynamics.aspx" target="_blank" rel="external">reduces drag</a></li>
<li><strong>Don’t brake when turning</strong><br>Want to turn right? Turn right! You have suspensions, right? Use them! Who cares about pesky maintenance costs when you can save pennies on fuel?</li>
<li><strong>Drive only downhill, and push your car uphill</strong> (#60)<br>Driving uphill costs more fuel than driving downhill. The obvious solution is to drive exclusively downhill. And only in strong tailwinds.<br>This is actually an extension of “Push it - 2” on the original list.<br>Since you are going downhill all the time, technically you will not be needing an engine or transmission to drive your car. They are heavy components that are <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fPcAH1kupug" target="_blank" rel="external">only there to weigh you down</a>.<br>In order to measure fuel economy, you will still need a motor in your car, so carry <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONGQHupxEmk" target="_blank" rel="external">one of those</a> with you.</li>
<li><strong>Dehydrate yourself</strong><br>You are made of 70% water. Removing all water from yourself yields more than a few pennies of savings.</li>
<li><strong>Replace your tires with bicycle tires</strong> (#106)<br>Higher pressure tires give you more fuel savings. Narrower tires are also more economic. What do? Bicycle tires, obviously!<br>Don’t forget to remove as many spokes as possible, as well!</li>
<li><strong>Replace your battery</strong><br>The average lead-acid car battery can weigh kilograms. You can find some CR1025 cells that weigh 0.7 grams.</li>
<li><strong>Wait for the snow plow</strong> (#80)<br>When the snow plow arrives, don’t forget to hitch a free ride in front of it.</li>
<li><strong>Strip naked</strong> (#93)<br>“If you regularly commute to work in hot weather, you might find that (stripping) mean you can run the air conditioner a little less.”</li>
<li><strong>Only drive during the day</strong><br>What do you need to drive during the night? Lights. What do you need to power the lights? Gasoline. Smart up, people!<br>Don’t forget to disconnect your headlights so the daylight running lights don’t come on (#34).</li>
<li><strong>Drive at either 50km/h or 90km/h</strong> (#99)<br>The two are the only correct answers.</li>
<li><strong>Remove all airbags</strong><br>Did you know that 99% of all airbags manufactured end up in the landfills unused? Chances are, you have not used yours, either. Drop the weight. Porsche does this for some of their cars.</li>
<li><strong>Lower your ride</strong><br>The lower your car is, the less drag it creates from the under panels (which I assume yours are a perfectly-flat sheet of metal).</li>
<li><strong>Reduce the size of your side mirrors</strong><br>Smaller, aftermarket mirrors reduce the surface area of your car, lowering aerodynamic resistance.</li>
<li><strong>Coat your road surface with oil</strong><br>We all know road surfaces are the largest source of friction when it comes to cars travelling in a spherical vacuum. The fuel-saving solution to that is to coat your daily commute with lubricants that help maintain your speed.</li>
<li><strong>Block your grille</strong><br>If you block your grille, that means there’s no air turbulence inside. Speed speed speed!</li>
<li><strong>Remove half of your lugnuts</strong><br>If you have four nuts on each wheel, take two off from each. You will want to keep the wheels balanced, <em>obviously</em>, for fuel economy reasons, so if your wheels are imbalanced in the first place, remove lug nuts, as necessary, from whichever side the wheel is heavier.<br>Remember you are using bicycle tires, so you can find lighter rims that fit them.</li>
<li><strong>Drive in a vacuum</strong><br>You cannot drive in space, but if you could, you will encounter far less aerodynamic drag than if you were driving on Earth.<br>The solution is to find a downhill vacuum on Earth to drive in, with the exception being in tailwinds stronger than your intended speed of 50km/h.</li>
<li><strong>Drive only in New Hampshire</strong><br><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seat_belt_legislation_in_the_United_States" target="_blank" rel="external">New Hampshire has no law around seat belts</a>, which I assume you have already removed from your vehicle, along with your stereo, speakers, air conditioning unit, dashboard, power windows, every seat apart from yours, and floor board for maximum weight reduction.<br>Driving in New Hampshire, therefore, should make you the best ubermiler.</li>
<li><strong>Don’t stop at border crossings</strong><br>Braking is just wasted energy. As you approach the border crossing, simply ease your throttle until the police bring you to a complete stop.</li>
</ol>
<p>In summary, your sweet ride will have/be:</p>
<ul>
<li>An electric motor, directly connected to a hearing aid battery</li>
<li>You, in the form of a jerky</li>
<li>Plastic windows, bicycle tires, and basically nothing else</li>
<li>In New Hampshire</li>
<li>Atop a frictionless oily road</li>
<li>Accelerating downhill in a vacuum at (at most) 9.81ms<sup>-2</sup>, or</li>
<li>Travelling the wind, at 90km/h. Remember to coast with your motor off</li>
</ul>
<p>Spending exactly no fuel, you will have beaten the world record by a long shot. Given enough time, you might even beat the fuel economy of Voyager 2!</p>
