    	<p>Once I was seven years old, my father told me,<br>“Think before you do” (or I will beat you)<br>Once I was seven years old</p>
<p>It was a big big world, but we (friends) thought we were bigger<br>Pushing each other to the limits, we were learning quicker<br>By eleven memorising poems and playing football<br>Never rich so we were out to make that steady figure</p>
<p>Once I was eleven years old, my father told me,<br>“Go read yourself a [rich dad poor dad book] (or you’ll die poorly).”<br>Once I was eleven years old</p>
<p>I always had that dream, like my father before me<br>So I started picking stocks, I started getting degrees<br>Something about that glory just always seemed to bore me<br>‘Cause only those I really love will ever really know me</p>
<p>Once I was twenty years old, my story got told<br>Before the morning sun, when life was lonely<br>Once I was twenty years old</p>
<p>“Don’t be trapped with a girl before you establish your career”<br>“Smart guy controls his pennis (<em>sic</em>) with his brian (<em>sic</em>) rather the vice versa”<br>I got my boys with me, at least those in favor<br>And if we don’t meet before I leave, I hope I’ll see you later</p>
<p>Once I was twenty years old, my story got told<br>I was forgetting about everything I saw before me<br>Once I was twenty years old</p>
<p>Soon we’ll be thirty years old, our properties have been sold<br>We’ve traveled around the world and we’re still roaming<br>Soon we’ll be thirty years old</p>
<p>I’m still learning about life<br>My woman is still imaginary<br>So I can sing myself some songs<br>And I can make up stories<br>None of my boys are with me<br>They are all out seeking glory<br>And some I had to keep around<br>My brother, I’m so sorry</p>
<p>Soon I’ll be sixty years old, my father gets however old<br>Remember life, and then your life becomes a better one<br>I made a man so happy when I wrote an email once<br>I hope just someone come and visit once or twice a month</p>
<p>Soon I’ll be sixty years old, will I think the world is cold<br>Or will I have a lot of children who can warm me?<br>Soon I’ll be sixty years old</p>
<p>Soon I’ll be sixty years old, will I think the world is cold<br>Or will I have a lot of children who can warm me?<br>Soon I’ll be sixty years old</p>
<p>Once I was seven years old, my father told me,<br>“Think before you do (or I will beat you)”<br>Once I was seven years old</p>
