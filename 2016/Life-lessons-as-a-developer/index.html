    	<p>I believe everyone should learn something every day. Here is what I learned every so often.</p>
<h1 id="Working-with-yourself"><a href="#Working-with-yourself" class="headerlink" title="Working with yourself"></a>Working with yourself</h1><h2 id="Keep-a-journal"><a href="#Keep-a-journal" class="headerlink" title="Keep a journal"></a>Keep a journal</h2><p>Chances are, you won’t remember everything.<br>Keep a journal. For work. For home. For your personal life (sometimes known as a diary).<br>Write down what you did that day, and what you learned that day.<br>Not only does that help you remember everything, it helps you hold yourself accountable, too.</p>
<h2 id="Remember-what-people-said"><a href="#Remember-what-people-said" class="headerlink" title="Remember what people said"></a>Remember what people said</h2><p>People tell you things all the time. Then they expect you to remember everything.<br>Chances are, you won’t remember everything.<br>What down what people say. Later, you can find out why something was done this way or not this way, and hold them accountable, too.</p>
<h2 id="Know-what-people-do-in-the-company"><a href="#Know-what-people-do-in-the-company" class="headerlink" title="Know what people do in the company"></a>Know what people do in the company</h2><p>It will eventually come to you that not everyone in your company is a developer, and they all do different things. They all <em>want</em> different things out of their jobs, and they have different objectives to what they do.<br>You should observe what they do, know the things they pay close attention to, and learn from them.</p>
<h2 id="Memorise-the-org-chart"><a href="#Memorise-the-org-chart" class="headerlink" title="Memorise the org chart"></a>Memorise the org chart</h2><p>It is rarely wise to let others tell you what to do, when they aren’t in your department.<br>This is less important in a startup, of course, but remember, no one budgeted your sprint time for other departments’ activities.<br>Likewise (37), if someone higher up messages you directly, there is no hard requirement for you to respond directly, either (though you should).</p>
<h2 id="There’s-no-point-if-you-aren’t-the-best"><a href="#There’s-no-point-if-you-aren’t-the-best" class="headerlink" title="There’s no point if you aren’t the best"></a>There’s no point if you aren’t the best</h2><p>No one hired you to be mediocre. Therefore, only only must you be the best, you must be <em>your</em> best.</p>
<h2 id="Log-your-sick-and-vacation-days"><a href="#Log-your-sick-and-vacation-days" class="headerlink" title="Log your sick (and vacation) days"></a>Log your sick (and vacation) days</h2><p>Everyone should be keeping track of themselves.<br>Eliminate the means of your company screwing you over on paid days off.</p>
<h2 id="Make-friends"><a href="#Make-friends" class="headerlink" title="Make friends"></a>Make friends</h2><p>On a personal level, you will want to build relationships with the people who work with you.<br>A happy colleague is a happy you.</p>
<h2 id="If-it-isn’t-difficult-it-isn’t-worth-doing"><a href="#If-it-isn’t-difficult-it-isn’t-worth-doing" class="headerlink" title="If it isn’t difficult, it isn’t worth doing"></a>If it isn’t difficult, it isn’t worth doing</h2><p>You learn only by challenging yourselves. Being an accountant for a decade doesn’t make you better at making spreadsheets than one who’s fresh out of college.<br>Use your time wisely. When it comes to problem selection, choose the hard ones.</p>
<h2 id="Leave-your-comfort-zone"><a href="#Leave-your-comfort-zone" class="headerlink" title="Leave your comfort zone"></a>Leave your comfort zone</h2><p>Work on other projects. <a href="/2016/How-to-learn-how-to-learn/">Start small. The most important thing is to start, and don’t give up until you finish.</a></p>
<h2 id="Help-out"><a href="#Help-out" class="headerlink" title="Help out"></a>Help out</h2><p>When people need help, that means the problem is either hard (in which you can learn), or easy (for which you earn respect.) It’s a win-win.<br>(Or they’re trying to waste your time with mundane things. Need to watch out for that.)</p>
<h2 id="Expand-your-horizons"><a href="#Expand-your-horizons" class="headerlink" title="Expand your horizons"></a>Expand your horizons</h2><p>The world doesn’t just do what you do; go out there and learn some stuff. If you know C++, learn Java.</p>
<h2 id="Excel-in-your-territory"><a href="#Excel-in-your-territory" class="headerlink" title="Excel in your territory"></a>Excel in your territory</h2><p>“Be good at what you do” should be your baseline.<br>“Be the best at what you do” should be your benchmark.<br>“Be the best at what everyone else does” should be your life goal.</p>
<h2 id="If-you-don’t-know-something-ask"><a href="#If-you-don’t-know-something-ask" class="headerlink" title="If you don’t know something, ask"></a>If you don’t know something, ask</h2><p>Asking questions almost always means you get a better idea at something, especially outside your area of expertise.<br>Also, asking questions, much like a favour, makes people like you. This is a form of social engineering.</p>
<h2 id="Don’t-wait-until-something-becomes-a-problem"><a href="#Don’t-wait-until-something-becomes-a-problem" class="headerlink" title="Don’t wait until something becomes a problem"></a>Don’t wait until something becomes a problem</h2><p>Whatever you built inevitably has bugs (unless you did write 10000 tests for every line of code, which is not unheard of.) Some bugs are merged with the expectation that they are never considered a use case for the feature.<br>If you have time, close those holes. You don’t want someone to hack you one day.</p>
<h2 id="Don’t-let-production-users-find-your-bugs-15"><a href="#Don’t-let-production-users-find-your-bugs-15" class="headerlink" title="Don’t let production users find your bugs (15)"></a>Don’t let production users find your bugs (15)</h2><p>Knowingly pushing buggy code, knowing there is a deadline, should not be part of your work culture.<br>Once you show your users buggy code, there is no way to undo that mistake.</p>
<p><strong>Counter argument</strong>: “If a flag can get it done let’s get it done. Launching is the best way to find problems to fix” (29)</p>
<h2 id="Be-ready-to-fix-things-on-production-42"><a href="#Be-ready-to-fix-things-on-production-42" class="headerlink" title="Be ready to fix things on production (42)"></a>Be ready to fix things on production (42)</h2><p>Production services should never have errors. One advantage of being in an error-free state is the error emails that you (must set up, and) receive will be actual errors that you must fix, so you don’t simply filter them away.</p>
<h2 id="Implement-to-the-spec-17"><a href="#Implement-to-the-spec-17" class="headerlink" title="Implement to the spec (17)"></a>Implement to the spec (17)</h2><p>Once a spec is done, whatever is within the spec, you do exactly what the spec says. <em>The only parts within your control is that which is not written down.</em></p>
<h2 id="“If-you-are-given-your-own-job-would-you-take-it-”"><a href="#“If-you-are-given-your-own-job-would-you-take-it-”" class="headerlink" title="“If you are given your own job, would you take it?”"></a>“If you are given your own job, would you take it?”</h2><p>To do a good job, you must like what you do. If you are offered your own job right now, and you don’t want to take it, then you are probably both in a bad job, and doing a bad job.</p>
<h1 id="Working-with-code"><a href="#Working-with-code" class="headerlink" title="Working with code"></a>Working with code</h1><h2 id="Write-tests"><a href="#Write-tests" class="headerlink" title="Write tests"></a>Write tests</h2><p>Tests can sometimes save you back more time than the time you spend writing them.<br>Well, depends on how the code was written, anyway. More about testable code later.</p>
<h2 id="Make-small-tasks-for-yourself-2"><a href="#Make-small-tasks-for-yourself-2" class="headerlink" title="Make small tasks for yourself (2)"></a>Make small tasks for yourself (2)</h2><p>Break your tasks into smaller, understandable pieces.</p>
<p>Someone might come to you and say, “build me this.”<br>When “this” is a huge endeavour, you will be overwhelmed by the requirements and deadline planning. You don’t actually know what “this” entails.</p>
<h2 id="Make-a-feature-branch-if-the-task-is-big-47"><a href="#Make-a-feature-branch-if-the-task-is-big-47" class="headerlink" title="Make a feature branch if the task is big (47)"></a>Make a feature branch if the task is big (47)</h2><p>A task can be so large that requires collaboration among developers in near real time.<br>In that case, it is probably better to work on a branch, pushing directly to it, and submit the final product for review, rather than submitting each individual change, which the QA must test one by one.</p>
<h2 id="Tests-will-fail"><a href="#Tests-will-fail" class="headerlink" title="Tests will fail"></a>Tests will fail</h2><p>And not only will they fail, they will be hard to fix. The 1/100/10000 rule states that for every second of code you write, you will spend 100 seconds writing tests, and 10000 more wondering why they don’t all pass. </p>
<h2 id="Make-small-changes"><a href="#Make-small-changes" class="headerlink" title="Make small changes"></a>Make small changes</h2><p>No one wants to read big changes. No one wants to test big changes.<br>When you make a big change, QA will ignore you until all other changes are merged.<br>So then you’ll have to rebase.<br>And get code reviews done, all over again.<br>Make small changes.</p>
<h2 id="Other-people’s-tech-debt-are-yours…"><a href="#Other-people’s-tech-debt-are-yours…" class="headerlink" title="Other people’s tech debt are yours…"></a>Other people’s tech debt are yours…</h2><p>If my experience is anything to go by, then I can say for certain that only you will care about technical debt.<br>Overestimate your stories so you get time to recover from the chronic debt.</p>
<p>If you happen to be a project lead, the tech debt you <em>allow</em> into your code base become yours, too. Make careful decisions before you approve or disapprove a change (45).</p>
<h2 id="…And-tech-debt-can-kill-you"><a href="#…And-tech-debt-can-kill-you" class="headerlink" title="…And tech debt can kill you"></a>…And tech debt can kill you</h2><p>After a lot of technical debt, you will start to develop mental issues. You will burn out and require actual medical care.<br>Do not ignore burnout! Take care of yourself first. Work isn’t everything.</p>
<h2 id="Users-are-stupid"><a href="#Users-are-stupid" class="headerlink" title="Users are stupid"></a>Users are stupid</h2><p>And they always, always overestimate their intelligence. There is an art to implementing unassuming UX, and you have not mastered it yet.</p>
<h2 id="Write-your-own-integration-tests"><a href="#Write-your-own-integration-tests" class="headerlink" title="Write your own integration tests"></a>Write your own integration tests</h2><p>If something breaks across components, the blame will simply be placed on you. To avoid things like that, cover yourself with some more tests.<br>No one (here) has ever said no to more tests.</p>
<h2 id="Your-code-represents-you"><a href="#Your-code-represents-you" class="headerlink" title="Your code represents you"></a>Your code represents you</h2><p>Make sure you like the looks of something before you push it out to the world. If you do a crappy job of designing an interface, your users will think</p>
<p>1) your product is a joke,<br>1) your company is a joke, and<br>1) you are a joke.</p>
<p>One or more of these may concern you. “Don’t feel pressured to push something you’re not happy with.” (30)</p>
<h2 id="Every-feature-must-have-an-on-off-switch-28"><a href="#Every-feature-must-have-an-on-off-switch-28" class="headerlink" title="Every feature must have an on/off switch (28)"></a>Every feature must have an on/off switch (28)</h2><blockquote>
<p>At least don’t make things worse than they are now [on production]. - The wise man</p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="Don’t-start-a-task-until-you-know-what-you-should-be-doing-28-42"><a href="#Don’t-start-a-task-until-you-know-what-you-should-be-doing-28-42" class="headerlink" title="Don’t start [a task] until you know what you should be doing (28, 42)"></a>Don’t start [a task] until you know what you should be doing (28, 42)</h2><p>Spearheading a task, without knowing its intended function and/or outcome, will simply waste your time if you get it wrong.<br>In the face of ambiguity, refuse the temptation to guess.</p>
<h2 id="Don’t-keep-builds-broken"><a href="#Don’t-keep-builds-broken" class="headerlink" title="Don’t keep builds broken"></a>Don’t keep builds broken</h2><p>If you keep (Jenkins) builds broken, how would you know when they find new bugs?<br>Failing builds should be dealt with swiftly.</p>
<h2 id="Document-your-changes-51"><a href="#Document-your-changes-51" class="headerlink" title="Document your changes (51)"></a>Document your changes (51)</h2><p>After a week or two, people will start to forget what does what, or what changed so it no longer does what.<br>It is probably for the best to dedicate some time to document the most updated state of any system, so you won’t need to read through all the code to find out how something works.</p>
<h1 id="Working-with-teams"><a href="#Working-with-teams" class="headerlink" title="Working with teams"></a>Working with teams</h1><h2 id="Demos-are-done-to-impress-3-38"><a href="#Demos-are-done-to-impress-3-38" class="headerlink" title="Demos are done to impress (~3, 38)"></a>Demos are done to impress (~3, 38)</h2><blockquote>
<p>“Only demo that which ought to impress”.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Don’t demo useless things.<br>The whole point of the demo is to show [people] what you’ve done (…), not to see what other people have done. Demos are a proof of work or proof of progress, something you should be proud of showing at the end of a development period.</p>
<h2 id="Business-deadlines-are-your-deadlines"><a href="#Business-deadlines-are-your-deadlines" class="headerlink" title="Business deadlines are your deadlines"></a>Business deadlines are your deadlines</h2><p>Usually, you aren’t hired to “work on a project”; you are hired to provide business value. And deadlines indirectly come from the business people who need your project done, so they can <em>actually</em> provide business value.</p>
<h2 id="As-a-team-no-one-knows-what-they’re-doing-4"><a href="#As-a-team-no-one-knows-what-they’re-doing-4" class="headerlink" title="As a team, no one knows what they’re doing (~4)"></a>As a team, no one knows what they’re doing (~4)</h2><p>One day someone might say, “developers should specify acceptance criteria.”<br>Then, in a month or two, the same person can come and say “the stakeholder (read: business) should provide a definition of done.”<br>No one knows what they’re doing.</p>
<h2 id="Pipelines-are-meant-to-be-balanced"><a href="#Pipelines-are-meant-to-be-balanced" class="headerlink" title="Pipelines are meant to be balanced"></a>Pipelines are meant to be balanced</h2><p>Too many code reviews at the same time and it burdens developers.<br>Too many things in test at the same time and it burdens QA.<br>Ideally, when a swim lane reaches a threshold, members should join code review and/or testing, so the overall velocity remains high.</p>
<p>Anyone can be QA. (Even if you suck at it, you can improve, right?)</p>
<h2 id="Don’t-let-QA-find-your-problems"><a href="#Don’t-let-QA-find-your-problems" class="headerlink" title="Don’t let QA find your problems"></a>Don’t let QA find your problems</h2><p>Your code is supposed to be free of bugs the moment it is submitted for review, so that when it passes code reviews, testing will find absolutely nothing.<br>Test your own code like it belongs to your arch enemy.</p>
<h2 id="Be-ready-to-replace-your-seniors"><a href="#Be-ready-to-replace-your-seniors" class="headerlink" title="Be ready to replace your seniors"></a>Be ready to replace your seniors</h2><p>Seniors, and even bosses come and go, and you should be the one ready to fill in their shoes. This gives you, supposedly, an advantage when it comes to readiness.</p>
<h2 id="Release-regularly-36"><a href="#Release-regularly-36" class="headerlink" title="Release regularly (36)"></a>Release regularly (36)</h2><p>The more regular releases are, the more likely bugs are to be found early.<br>Continuous deployment is its own beast so we will look into that on its own.</p>
<p>If you lead a project, you must (at least tell yourself that) release your project at the end of every development period.</p>
<h2 id="Success-metrics-should-be-independent-from-each-other"><a href="#Success-metrics-should-be-independent-from-each-other" class="headerlink" title="Success metrics should be independent from each other"></a>Success metrics should be independent from each other</h2><p>If you set your own goals, make sure they don’t depend on each other. This allows you to meet these goals one by one, and ensure you actually made (e.g. 3) goals, rather than just (e.g. 1).</p>
<h2 id="Plan-the-backlog-not-the-sprint-27"><a href="#Plan-the-backlog-not-the-sprint-27" class="headerlink" title="Plan the backlog, not the sprint (27)"></a>Plan the backlog, not the sprint (27)</h2><p>Developers should be taking the first task at the top of the backlog for more work.<br>Unordered backlogs mean unhappy developers (because unhappy businessmen don’t get the right features done). (34)</p>
<blockquote>
<p>If you don’t plan the sprints, when will they stop failing? - The wise man</p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="Don’t-do-multiple-tasks-at-the-same-time-50"><a href="#Don’t-do-multiple-tasks-at-the-same-time-50" class="headerlink" title="Don’t do multiple tasks at the same time (50)"></a>Don’t do multiple tasks at the same time (50)</h2><p>Chances are that you will end up running out of time, failing to merge all of them. Work on one thing, finish it, then work on another.</p>
<h2 id="Make-suggestions-not-criticisms-29"><a href="#Make-suggestions-not-criticisms-29" class="headerlink" title="Make suggestions, not criticisms (29)"></a>Make suggestions, not criticisms (29)</h2><p>Doing code reviews can be fun, especially when you bash someone else’s head in for writing atrocious code.<br>But resist that sadistic temptation. Help the other person grow by making suggestions. Forcing yourself to architectural questions also helps with your critical thinking.</p>
<h2 id="Keep-confidential-information-confidential-35"><a href="#Keep-confidential-information-confidential-35" class="headerlink" title="Keep confidential information confidential (35)"></a>Keep confidential information confidential (35)</h2><p>Put your company in a good light. Don’t write stupid blog posts that expose confidential trade secrets.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Let’s conduce ourselves as professionally as we can.<br>Don’t feel obligated to tell your users how things work (37).</p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="Gauge-your-sprint-velocities-39"><a href="#Gauge-your-sprint-velocities-39" class="headerlink" title="Gauge your sprint velocities (39)"></a>Gauge your sprint velocities (39)</h2><p>Put too little into one sprint, and you, as a business, will fail.<br>Try to put too much into one sprint, and the sprint will certainly fail.</p>
<p>Leverage historical data to judge how fast your developers can work.</p>
<h2 id="Have-retrospectives-1"><a href="#Have-retrospectives-1" class="headerlink" title="Have retrospectives (1)"></a>Have retrospectives (1)</h2><p>Retrospectives are a way to reflect on what you have done, and to find ways to improve from then onward.<br>Retrospectives should have actionable items (40) that are SMART, and to be revisited the next time, so you can be sure you improved over time.</p>
<h2 id="You-don’t-fail-a-sprint-the-team-fails-the-sprint"><a href="#You-don’t-fail-a-sprint-the-team-fails-the-sprint" class="headerlink" title="You don’t fail a sprint; the team fails the sprint"></a>You don’t fail a sprint; the team fails the sprint</h2><p>There can be no blame games (40) when a sprint fails.<br>If you have unfinished business, and everyone else completed all their work, then you suck.<br>If everyone finished their work, except Bob, then the team sucks.<br>There can be no blame games.</p>
