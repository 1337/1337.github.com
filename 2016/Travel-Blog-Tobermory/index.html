    	<p>For <em>absolutely no reason whatsoever</em>, I got myself a holiday to <a href="https://www.google.com/maps/place/Tobermory,+ON" target="_blank" rel="external">Tobermory</a>, a place that my colleague said was a nice place to visit. She was right.</p>
<p>Just a few hours’ drive from wherever you think I live, and yet a few hours really isn’t the kind of time you would normally plan on wasting, I went on a drive there, again, for <em>absolutely no reason whatsoever</em>, to where the province’s national marine park lies.</p>
<p>Day one involved ending up at <a href="https://www.google.com/maps/place/Owen+Sound,+ON" target="_blank" rel="external">Owen Sound</a>, a town that tries to be a city, and subsequently travelling to Tobermory, where all the promises come true. Well, as it turned out, Owen Sound was a bit of a ghost town… at least for the parts it called downtown.</p>
<p>Ordered a takeout sushi bento for <em>absolutely no reason whatsoever</em>. For whatever reason, I always get Japanese food whenever I feel like <em>it</em>. <a href="http://yummyyummycuisine.ca/" target="_blank" rel="external">Yummy Yummy</a>, the place, half empty at the time, interestingly, was not bad. The salmon was dry and tasteless, but the rest of the bento box was great.</p>
<p>The Indian Falls was nearby, so I went there. After having just been to Elora, this manmade waterfall, (if it wasn’t manmade, it sure looks like it was.) despite its numerous defencive strategies to prevent the average hiker from reaching there (misleading paths), was underwhelming. I left soon afterwards.</p>
<p>The journey continued on with a drive to Cape Croker, apparently a native American stronghold, and the host of a lighthouse, creatively called the <a href="https://www.google.com/maps/place/Cape+Croker+Lighthouse/" target="_blank" rel="external">Cape Croker Lighthouse</a>. The path turned from tarmac to gravel, but my car journeyed on. When I arrived, it was covered with pride. And nearby cluster flies.</p>
<p>No time to waste. Time to actually go to Tobermory. I buckled up (hehe) and cruise controlled all the way to the motel, the place that claimed to be a motel, but was actually much nicer. Friendly man there explained that there was a router, but there was effectively no Wi-Fi inside my room. Nice. He also brought forth a helpful map… in retrospect, not that helpful, because “downtown” is literally that one street (Bay St.), and the big/little tubs (like bays or lagoons).</p>
<p>Well, guy said the <a href="https://www.google.com/maps/place/Big+Tub+Lighthouse/" target="_blank" rel="external">Big Tub Lighthouse</a> was 45 minutes of walking, but only 2 minutes of drive away. <em>Challenge Accepted.</em> The drive ended up to be more like four minutes, but it was fast nevertheless. The lighthouse was one of the most complete, best preserved lighthouses on this trip.</p>
<p>Had dinner at the creatively-named <a href="https://www.google.com/maps/place/The+Fish+%26+Chip+Place/@45.2547777,-81.6635033,19z/data=!4m12!1m6!3m5!1s0x0:0x14ed757805c10e4!2sThe+Coffee+Shop!8m2!3d45.2545111!4d-81.6635294!3m4!1s0x0:0x814d18d19f9ab060!8m2!3d45.2547542!4d-81.6630808" target="_blank" rel="external">“The Fish and Chip Place”</a>. It advertised Georgian Bay Whitefish, which, of course, I had to try. It tasted rather gamy. That one museum I visited later tomorrow taught me why.</p>
<p>Wait, it was 7pm and there was one more hour left until sunset. What would Jesus do? He would go to The Grotto! Driving there, the camp guard said the national park was actually closed, no one was here to handle the ticketing, and that if I were to go see The Grotto, I would be there after sunset, and it would be impossible to see anything.</p>
<p>Challenge Accepted, as usual.</p>
<p>And challenge completed.</p>
<p>The view was breathtaking. The rocks, the sun, the open bay.</p>
<p>But I knew I would be in trouble if I do not exit the national park by the time the sun actually sets, so I rushed back to my car.</p>
<p>The morning after, I purchased a light roast coffee from what they call <a href="https://www.google.com/maps/place/The+Coffee+Shop/@45.2547777,-81.6635033,19.38z/data=!4m5!3m4!1s0x0:0x14ed757805c10e4!8m2!3d45.2545111!4d-81.6635294" target="_blank" rel="external">The Coffee Shop</a>. Next, I visited the Visitors Centre, where I should have gone the night before. It was a great hike, full of interesting fungi, and to the watchtower, where I saw the largest unbroken stretch of forest in Southern Ontario.</p>
<p>Having booked a cruise to the Flowerpot Island, part of the <a href="https://www.google.com/maps/place/Fathom+Five+National+Marine+Park/@45.2825747,-81.6312099,11.92z/data=!4m5!3m4!1s0x0:0xf781ff1812dfe401!8m2!3d45.2818924!4d-81.7238617" target="_blank" rel="external">Fathom Five National Marine Park</a>, I took a glass bottom ship around the bay, the shipwreck, and the lighthouse I had visited the night before.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.google.com/maps/place/Flowerpot+Island/@45.2966019,-81.6144883,13.67z/data=!4m5!3m4!1s0x0:0xf3483ffdba2555cf!8m2!3d45.2988072!4d-81.61726" target="_blank" rel="external">The flowerpot island</a> featured three fantastic hikes, two flowerpots, and an amazing Parks Canada staff called Sheila (I think). She was just so enthusiastic about her work, despite all that it was being talking about the island, and ahanding out plastic bags all day long. She left a distinct memory in my mind. She had a very bright smile. She told me all about the island, including the plants and exotic orchids that were not flowering at the time. She loved her work. She loved Georgian Bay. She loved Canada.</p>
<p>I took place in two of the hikes. The first hike, which everyone goes on and back out of, was good. At the end was a lighthouse, or, more accurately, a lightstation, which was underwhelming compared to the sights from the viewing platform. The second hike, towards <a href="https://www.google.com/maps/place/Tobermory,+ON/@45.297085,-81.6285995,16.75z/data=!4m5!3m4!1s0x4d2d0ba9fb4f9461:0x3b2e70b0e46a3526!8m2!3d45.2533625!4d-81.6645411" target="_blank" rel="external">Marl Bed</a>, a place so hidden it is not even visible on Google Maps, was a bit more difficult. With 50 minutes left to spare before the return ship arrives, I ventured on.</p>
<p>Jesus <em>does</em> provide.</p>
<p>The express ship back was nothing short of exciting; thank the cruise booking staff for “accidentally” booking this ship for me, so that I had two hours of hiking time. And thank her for booking the fast ship back, for it was a unique(ly exciting) experience on a choppy sea.</p>
<p>On my way back, I visited Inglis Falls, the place I had missed completely on my way to Owen Sound. It looked a lot better than Indian Falls. Of course, after having been to Banff, nothing really quite surprised me.</p>
<p>All this, I was incredibly lucky in visiting the area while taking a weekday off. Had I not done that, it would have been packed with people everywhere I go. A weekday trip made the town exquisite, pleasant, and photogenic as well.</p>
<p>The overall fuel consumption was 6.05 L/100km. It will probably never hit that low again.</p>
