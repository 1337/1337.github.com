    	<p><a href="https://xkcd.com/320/" target="_blank" rel="external">One of the first xkcd comics</a> (#320) describes a 28-hour day, where six of such days sum up to 168 hours, which is also what seven 24-hour days add up to. The person would then stay up for 20 hours, sleep eight hours after that, and repeat the process. Of course, ignoring the daylight factor (which, if you have a daylight-dependent sleeping schedule, you would not be reading this in the first place), a person still needs to work, play, planning such a six-day week around the world that revolves around them. What does that look like?</p>
<p><img src="/image/7-day.png" alt=""></p>
<p>If your workplace allows somewhat flexible hours, or if they only specify core hours, then by shifting your Tuesday schedule a bit late, and your Friday schedule a bit early, then you are only 10% deviated from the rest of the world, in a typical 40-hour work week. If the place of employment really wants you to put 40 hours during <em>their</em> workdays, just shift that excel spreadsheet left by four days. Now, you start work two hours early on their Monday, and start two hours late on their Friday. In such a plan, like normal human beings, you will not be working during normal weekends.</p>
<h2 id="What-does-it-look-like-to-you"><a href="#What-does-it-look-like-to-you" class="headerlink" title="What does it look like to you?"></a>What does it look like to you?</h2><p><img src="/image/6-day.png" alt=""></p>
<p>At first, if you commit to centering your life around your sleep, then you get eight hours of sleep at “midnight” every day. The time at which you leave for work will be drastically different every “day”. On day 1 (whatever name you give it), you will work at 10am. On day 4, you will start working at 8pm, finishing at “28pm”, your midnight.</p>
<h2 id="Bonus-exercise-when-do-shops-open"><a href="#Bonus-exercise-when-do-shops-open" class="headerlink" title="Bonus exercise: when do shops open?"></a>Bonus exercise: <em>when do shops open?</em></h2><p>Enough about work. Your life is a lot more than just work. How about food? How about entertainment? When are things open relative to your 6-day week? Well, highlighting the 9am~7pm range, when shops are typically open and available to you?</p>
<p><img src="/image/6-day-ds.png" alt=""></p>
<p>Well, as it turns out, there are not that many hours that you have to shop when both you and other human beings are awake. On most days, you can get away with shopping after work; it might be a bit strange for your “weekend” day, for there are three shopping hours immediately after you wake up, and three more right before you go to bed. No more eight-hour activities for you!</p>
