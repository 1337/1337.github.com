<ol>
<li>Add keywords like “underwear, car loan, suicide watch” in white font in your emails to get your recipients ad-targeted by them.</li>
<li>“Hey there’s something different about you today, I like it”</li>
<li>When making a multiple choice quiz, make all the correct answers the first one.</li>
<li>Introduce yourself with different names at a party/event.</li>
<li>Slightly rearrange things on someone’s desk.</li>
<li>When reserving a table, name yourself “par par” or “for for”, which forces the waiter/waitress to call out “par par party for two” or “for for for four”.</li>
<li>When answering the phone, answer with “Hi, can I speak to [caller] please”.</li>
<li>Always say “See you tomorrow”, whether or not it is actually going to happen.</li>
<li>End a call or drive-thru with “thanks I love you”.</li>
<li>Bring snacks into the office on April Fool’s day.</li>
<li>Change terms slightly. Game of the Thrones, SnapChap, Los Vegas.</li>
<li>Remember someone’s story, then later tell it back to them as if it happened to you.</li>
<li>Wear a shirt and tie for no reason to work every so often.</li>
<li>When someone asks you if you want something out of courtesy, catch them off guard by actually saying yes. Yes, you would like water.</li>
<li>Reference imaginary famous people in your conversation, and see if anyone notices you made them up.</li>
<li>When someone stops talking, look at them in the eyes until they start talking again.</li>
<li>When someone sneezes, say “thank you” instead of “bless you”. Also works: tell them to shut up, and they will say “thank you” back because they were expecting a “bless you”.</li>
<li>Make up skills for people you barely know. Did you know Maggie can fix watches?</li>
<li>When entering an elevator with people already inside, face them.</li>
<li>“Get them heavily involved in a good conversation, while standing, and just hand them something. Don’t look at it, keep the conversation going, keep eye contact, and hand them anything from a tennis ball to a rock you just picked up. Almost every time they’ll grab it without thinking. Works even better if talking and walking. See how much stuff they can hold.”</li>
<li>“Thanks, you too” to any service industry worker.</li>
<li>Say “to go” when ordering from the drive thru. If you want to make yourself look stupid, “for here” works too.</li>
<li>Claim that you have never heard of a well known country, like Spain.</li>
<li>When people give you a phone to take a group picture, turn around and take a selfie with them.</li>
</ol>
