    	<p>Continuing from <a href="/2016/Calgary-The-Journey/">my trip to Calgary</a>, I rented a car, drove to the Rockies, and had the time of my life. At a huge cost. Story below.</p>
<h1 id="Day-1-Johnston-Canyon-Lake-Louise"><a href="#Day-1-Johnston-Canyon-Lake-Louise" class="headerlink" title="Day 1: Johnston Canyon / Lake Louise"></a>Day 1: Johnston Canyon / Lake Louise</h1><p>In the company of a righteous man in the eyes of the Lord, his fiancee at the time, her brother, and her three best friends, I drove along to Banff National Park, the first city I have encountered that has an entrance fee. The fee is also calculated in a very odd manner: by paying ~$10 per day per person, you get a single receipt which you must affix to your vehicle. (So… should I hide all my passengers?) This same receipt can also be used as a museum pass, but you must keep the receipt affixed to the car. (Which means you can never use it)</p>
<p>Anyway, we hiked.</p>
<p><img src="/image/banff/image147.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p>It became immediately clear that I was too old for moderate-altitude hiking. Twenty year-old peers championed the rocks with ease; I felt large rocks on my chest. The resulting scenery was worthy of the exercise.</p>
<p><img src="/image/banff/image146.jpg" alt=""><br><img src="/image/banff/image145.jpg" alt=""><br><img src="/image/banff/image144.jpg" alt=""><br><img src="/image/banff/image142.jpg" alt=""><br><img src="/image/banff/image129.jpg" alt=""><br><img src="/image/banff/image123.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p>This is the closest hiking trail from Calgary (I think?) making it also the most crowded. That did not stop us from exploring the waterfall at the end of it:</p>
<p><img src="/image/banff/image122.jpg" alt=""><br><img src="/image/banff/image118.jpg" alt=""><br><img src="/image/banff/image116.jpg" alt=""><br><img src="/image/banff/image115.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p>That part of the trail is called the Lower Falls. This is called the LGBTQ tree.</p>
<p><img src="/image/banff/image114.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p>After the hike, we had, some for the first time, “afternoon tea”. At an amazing cost, you receive three plates worth of desserts, as well as your personal pot of tea. I had the Safari something; it was good.</p>
<p>(No meaningful pictures taken during the meal)</p>
<p>The weather was acting up at the time, so Lake Louise gave a mediocre impression. (Spoiler: I went back)</p>
<p><img src="/image/banff/image105.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p>After Lake Louise, the six travellers returned to Calgary, where they intended to stay for the week. I drove to Banff (town proper), and I intended to stay for the week.</p>
<p>It was a beautiful, beautiful town. Also a simple one. Essentially a tourist attraction, the entire town is centered around its main street, whose upper portion was solely occupied by hotels and accommodations, and whose lower portion was solely occupied by attractions like shops, museums, and parks.</p>
<p>Even in the rain, the sights were breathtaking. (The altitude was also breathtaking.) So many Europeans. Swiss, English, German, and Dutch!</p>
<p><img src="/image/banff/image99.jpg" alt=""></p>
<h1 id="Day-2-Two-Jack-Lake-Lake-Minnewanka-Gondola-Cave-and-Basin-Whyte-Museum"><a href="#Day-2-Two-Jack-Lake-Lake-Minnewanka-Gondola-Cave-and-Basin-Whyte-Museum" class="headerlink" title="Day 2: Two Jack Lake, Lake Minnewanka, Gondola, Cave and Basin, Whyte Museum"></a>Day 2: Two Jack Lake, Lake Minnewanka, Gondola, Cave and Basin, Whyte Museum</h1><p>With the forecast being rain for the day, I woke up early for a drive to Two Jack Lake, which was a beautiful place, with only a few Asians fiddling about.</p>
<p><img src="/image/banff/image420.jpg" alt=""><br><img src="/image/banff/image415.jpg" alt=""><br><img src="/image/banff/image414.jpg" alt=""><br><img src="/image/banff/image412.jpg" alt=""><br><img src="/image/banff/image411.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p>The next destination was Lake Minnewanka, which, according to what I had overheard from a tour guide around at the time, was a man-made lake. “Oh wow,” I thought to myself, “I should get a tour guide to get the most out of this trip.” I didn’t.</p>
<p><img src="/image/banff/image410.jpg" alt=""><br><img src="/image/banff/image406.jpg" alt=""><br><img src="/image/banff/image403.jpg" alt=""><br><img src="/image/banff/image402.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p>The rain had not subsided entirely; I kept my activities in-town.</p>
<p>The ferris-wheel-on-a-chain Gondola was one of the things each tourist should see. I, having just bitten the inside of my mouth at the base of the station, got irrationally annoyed, and abandoned the idea in the process. But I was there.</p>
<p><img src="/image/banff/image388.jpg" alt=""><br><img src="/image/banff/image392.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p>Where else can you go on a rainy day? Museums, I suppose. The museums in Banff are interesting. The first one I went to was the <a href="http://www.pc.gc.ca/eng/lhn-nhs/ab/caveandbasin/index.aspx" target="_blank" rel="external">Cave and Basin</a>, which was more park than museum.</p>
<p><img src="/image/banff/image71.jpg" alt=""><br><img src="/image/banff/image79.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p>The <em>Cave</em> was a hole in the ground. Inside the cave was a pool of water, which smelled like sulphur (hydrogen sulphide). The experience was unique to me.</p>
<p><img src="/image/banff/image91.jpg" alt=""><br><img src="/image/banff/image90.jpg" alt=""><br><img src="/image/banff/image86.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p>The <em>Basin</em> was effectively a pool of hot spring water, also full of minerals. They claim that <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Banff_Springs_snail" target="_blank" rel="external">endangered snails</a> live in the water. Despite the staff pointing into the (cess)pool, I could not see any.</p>
<p><img src="/image/banff/image85.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p>Inside the park was also a recreation of what was supposedly the first hotel in Banff.</p>
<p><img src="/image/banff/image73.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p>Next, I went to the Whyte museum, which I would not reasonably recommend. If you want history, go to Glenbow museum. If you want fun, go outside. Nevertheless, being a boring place, it attracts many rainy-day elderly people. Here are some pictures of the museum.</p>
<p><img src="/image/banff/image61.jpg" alt=""><br><img src="/image/banff/image67.jpg" alt=""><br><img src="/image/banff/image64.jpg" alt=""><br><img src="/image/banff/image63.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p>Nearing the end of the day, I returned to town with an empty stomach. From the supermarket (the Safeway is now an IGA), I purchased a piece of “pure AAA western beef”. Using the recipe <a href="http://www.marthastewart.com/343792/pan-fried-steak" target="_blank" rel="external">most available at the time</a>, I pan-fried it with seasoning. It was glorious.</p>
<p><img src="/image/banff/image59.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p>(No meaningful pictures taken during the meal)</p>
<h1 id="Day-3-Moraine-Lake-Lake-Louise-Bow-Lake-Peyto-Lake"><a href="#Day-3-Moraine-Lake-Lake-Louise-Bow-Lake-Peyto-Lake" class="headerlink" title="Day 3: Moraine Lake, Lake Louise, Bow Lake, Peyto Lake"></a>Day 3: Moraine Lake, Lake Louise, Bow Lake, Peyto Lake</h1><p>It’s Lake Day! I began my <a href="https://www.google.ca/maps/dir/Banff,+AB/Moraine+Lake,+Improvement+District+No.+9,+AB/Lake+Louise,+AB/Bow+Lake,+Improvement+District+No.+9,+AB/Peyto+Lake,+Improvement+District+No.+9,+AB/Banff,+AB/@51.4410197,-116.3268833,10z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m38!4m37!1m5!1m1!1s0x5370ca45910c4afd:0xcaafaebedaac9463!2m2!1d-115.5707694!2d51.1783629!1m5!1m1!1s0x53775bcbf58ee517:0x42c8a7a2c3c05c95!2m2!1d-116.1860049!2d51.3217416!1m5!1m1!1s0x53775d28a0e1ce11:0x3c373c7b6365bce6!2m2!1d-116.1773193!2d51.4253851!1m5!1m1!1s0x5377798c82924145:0xee9f124083b5d300!2m2!1d-116.460027!2d51.6712779!1m5!1m1!1s0x537778716d70aaaf:0xa7adc4f7892b437b!2m2!1d-116.5226977!2d51.7255153!1m5!1m1!1s0x5370ca45910c4afd:0xcaafaebedaac9463!2m2!1d-115.5707694!2d51.1783629!3e0" target="_blank" rel="external">250km journey</a> early in the morning. The day would be sunny (most places), so I planned the day outdoors.</p>
<p>Moraine Lake was by far the most beautiful:</p>
<p><img src="/image/banff/image370.jpg" alt=""><br><img src="/image/banff/image364.jpg" alt=""><br><img src="/image/banff/image53.jpg" alt=""><br><img src="/image/banff/image52.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p>I attempted to take a mount of rocks that was at the base of the lake. It produced some of the best pictures I have taken on this trip. But it was also the coldest (-1 C in June? What) so I could not stay for long. Bizarrely, Lake Louise, which is just 10km away, was much warmer at the time, so I went for a complete hike there, from one end of the lake, to the opposite end.</p>
<p><img src="/image/banff/image362.jpg" alt=""><br><img src="/image/banff/image361.jpg" alt=""><br><img src="/image/banff/image360.jpg" alt=""><br><img src="/image/banff/image358.jpg" alt=""><br><img src="/image/banff/image354.jpg" alt=""><br><img src="/image/banff/image351.jpg" alt=""><br><img src="/image/banff/image349.jpg" alt=""><br><img src="/image/banff/image343.jpg" alt=""><br><img src="/image/banff/image339.jpg" alt=""><br><img src="/image/banff/image335.jpg" alt=""><br><img src="/image/banff/image334.jpg" alt=""><br><img src="/image/banff/image333.jpg" alt=""><br><img src="/image/banff/image331.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p>The opposite end of the lake could be walked on; it had a solid clay foundation. Beyond the clay, there was a spot for climbers, and a lot of<br>warning signs about wild bears.</p>
<p>My next step was Bow Lake, which was a short drive north of Lake Louise. It was less famous for obvious reasons.</p>
<p><img src="/image/banff/image43.jpg" alt=""><br><img src="/image/banff/image42.jpg" alt=""><br><img src="/image/banff/image41.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p>There are no real restaurants along the way, so I packed a number of snacks for the day. The final destination of the day was Peyto Lake, which could/should be seen from Bow Summit, another one of the Bow places one must experience.</p>
<p><img src="/image/banff/image38.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p>Bow Summit was a sharp climb, but also a rewarding one. Atop the summit, you see a lake so blue, it may seem unreal:</p>
<p><img src="/image/banff/image36.jpg" alt=""><br><img src="/image/banff/image34.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p>To use <a href="http://banffandbeyond.com/is-peyto-lake-really-that-blue/" target="_blank" rel="external">the words of Audrey the blogger</a>: “Peyto Lake really is that blue? Yes it is!”</p>
<h1 id="Day-4-Banff-Park-Museum-Bow-Falls-Banff-Downtown-Tunnel-Mountain-Trail"><a href="#Day-4-Banff-Park-Museum-Bow-Falls-Banff-Downtown-Tunnel-Mountain-Trail" class="headerlink" title="Day 4: Banff Park Museum, Bow Falls, Banff Downtown, Tunnel Mountain Trail"></a>Day 4: Banff Park Museum, Bow Falls, Banff Downtown, Tunnel Mountain Trail</h1><p>Taking a break from all that driving, I stayed largely in town on Thursday.</p>
<p>A lady by the name of “Lisa” may be delighted to learn that there is, in fact, a museum about itself: the Banff Park Museum.</p>
<p><img src="/image/banff/image30.jpg" alt=""><br><img src="/image/banff/image29.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p>The museum also had other interesting exhibits, such as taxidermy birds, elks, goats, and bears. They claim to have placed them exactly how they have always been placed, including having random specimens cluttered here and there, because the museum is a museum about itself, and this was how the museum has always been. Can’t argue with that.</p>
<p><img src="/image/banff/image26.jpg" alt=""><br><img src="/image/banff/image27.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p>Next was a hike down the Bow River Trail and the Bow Falls trail, leading to… Bow Falls. Strangely enough, I have lost all pictures of the actual hike and the fall itself, so you may consult <a href="https://www.google.ca/search?q=bow+falls" target="_blank" rel="external">Google</a> for pictures. The only surviving picture is of a fake Indian tribe leader, looking for “donations” from passersby.</p>

<p>After the hike, I returned downtown. Downtown Banff is a strange, and beautiful place. They have a <em>THE</em> PRESBYTERIAN CHURCH IN CANADA, majestic since 1830, and a “Banff Avenue Square” that is, rather amusingly, a circle.</p>

<p>Finally, when the day was about to end (that being 6pm), I went for an in-town hike at Tunnel Mountain. The inclination was ridiculous (40 degrees uphill in the beginning?), but it got easier as I ascended.</p>

<p>The view got better and better, until I finally reached the peak:</p>

<p>I will never forget that hike. It was worth every second of my life.</p>

Eight hours of it! The brokeback (literal) journey would get me to Jasper, another town you need to pay to get into, and whatever it was it had to offer that one of my colleagues raved so much about. But first, I must drive two hours to each Peyto Lake, where one can exit the vehicle and stretch for air.</p>
<p>The drive along the <a href="http://www.icefieldsparkway.ca/" target="_blank" rel="external">Icefields Parkway</a> was a beautiful, but an extremely boring one. Lasting 232km, you see mountains rivers, beyond which, more mountains and rivers. Sometimes dried riverbeds. No surprises. The two-lane highway forces the driver (me) to pass trailers while crossing to the opposite side of the road. Had it not been a Hyundai Accident with something like a 1.6L engine on eco, it could have been less of a thrill. After an hour of convincing myself that I was still awake (or even alive), I arrived at the Columbia Icefields area. Yes, the <a href="http://athletics.uwaterloo.ca/sports/2010/7/21/Columbia_Icefield.aspx" target="_blank" rel="external">Columbia Ice Field</a> was named after it, because that stupid school loves references. The real ice field was breathtaking, again, because it was 2.5km above sea level, and it was the right altitude for the average human to be out of breath.</p>
<p><img src="/image/banff/image308.jpg" alt=""><br><img src="/image/banff/image307.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p>Maybe Columbia Icefields isn’t Athabasca Glacier. But to me, it was close enough. I went a glacier; it was amazingly accessible. You can even see tours <em>on</em> the glacier, for the more adventurous. It was too cold and windy to take a steady photo, but the experience was surreal. Highly recommended destination!</p>
<p><img src="/image/banff/image305.jpg" alt=""><br><img src="/image/banff/image303.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p>Another 45 minutes of driving brought me to Athabasca Falls. Unlike other falls in this country, the fall itself was not the attraction; its surreal rock formation was.</p>
<p><img src="/image/banff/image448.jpg" alt=""><br><img src="/image/banff/image449.jpg" alt=""><br><img src="/image/banff/image450.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p>And, finally, following another half an hour of driving, the journey ended in Jasper, a friendly town that spells out everything. I took a picture of a restaurant. You might know what type of restaurant it is.</p>
<p><img src="/image/banff/image441.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p>The town has a town square that looks a bit like Victoria Park. It also has an old, preserved train station that is <em>actually</em> still a train station, with a Greyhound station inside of it.</p>
<p><img src="/image/banff/image442.jpg" alt=""><br><img src="/image/banff/image443.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p>A few minutes outside of town was Maligne Canyon, the #2 destination, according to TripAdvisor. Indeed, it was the second best hike I have ever had. The canyon was deep, and its growth of lichens along the way reminded me that this place has regular, harsh winters.</p>
<p><img src="/image/banff/image451.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p>And, after all that, I was content with my trip. I have had the time of my life. Now, a four-hour drive home (Banff)…</p>
<h1 id="Return-to-Calgary"><a href="#Return-to-Calgary" class="headerlink" title="Return to Calgary"></a>Return to Calgary</h1><p>The dawn of Saturday marked my return to Calgary, where a righteous man in the eyes of the Lord were to marry a woman, also righteous in the eyes of the Lord, but shall both remain anonymous (unless I have the permission to associate with their identities), in holy matrimony. I attended the wedding. Of course, since I have no business posting other people’s faces on the Internet, there shall be no pictures. Here are two pandas without eyes…</p>

<h1 id="The-real-cost"><a href="#The-real-cost" class="headerlink" title="The real cost"></a>The real cost</h1><p>This was the first time I drove in the province of Alberta, and the first time I have ever rented a car. Guess what I did on the first day? Paid too much attention to the speed cameras, and ran a red light. Not sure what that proves.</p>
